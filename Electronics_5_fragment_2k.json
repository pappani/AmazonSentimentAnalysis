Now, I find myself using only this radio. The main reason is the digital frequency display. You always know exactly where you're tuned. It's such a major difference. I like analog tuning; I like twisting the dial to go from one station to the next. With the S350, I don't have to guess where I am on the dial. The FM section is great; very little overloading in my very difficult reception area, with great weak signal pickup. The AM section is superb; there are Wide and Narrow bandwidth choices that are usable on both local and distant stations (a bandwidth switch lets you choose the best tradeoff between interference rejection and audio fidelity; on the S350, both choices are well designed--with the Superadio, the Wide setting is so wide that you can only use it on very strong, local stations). I find myself listening to a station 500 miles away in the Wide bandwidth mode most nights. The Shortwave section is a joy to listen to. The S350 is light, even with batteries, and produces a nice sound--not quite the same bass response as the Superadio, but very pleasant. If you like a slightly retro design (no station memories, no slewing buttons, but it does have a nice big tuning knob PLUS a fine tuning knob) and appreciate knowing exactly to what station your radio is tuned, this is what you want.

So I was on a quest to find a new workout band, one that would give a secure fit, be well-constructed, and be reasonably priced.This lil' number fits the bill for those aspects.  The silicone skin to surround the iPod is flexible yet sturdy, and it comes with screen and track-wheel protectors if you want to put them on.  (I elected not to, as I'm horrible at putting them on well without air bubbles everywhere).  Also, the skins come in really nice colors---I got a purple one to match my purple iPod.  So even though your iPod looks cooler without the skin, it still looks decent in its silicone armor.It's a simple design---once the iPod is slipped into the silicone skin, you thread the velcro armband through the slits in the back.  Secure it to your arm, adjust it for comfort, and you're ready to go.  The band is snug but not uncomfortable once you adjust it to your preference, so you don't have to worry about it slipping down.In the future, if I needed another armband, I'd buy products from Grantwood again.P.S. Although the product details say that you shouldn't be taking the iPod out and putting it in frequently---saying that you should leave it in even when charging---Apple says that you should take the iPod out when you need to charge it.  I would think it has the possibility of heating up too much in there when charging.  The silicone seems sturdy enough to withstand use, anyway.  Obviously, just take some care in pulling out your iPod and replacing it in the skin if you plan to do it frequently.EDIT: As of 3/7/2012, this is still holding up just fine.  I do take my iPod out when I charge it---I'm just gentle when I take it out and put it back in.

In search of a replacement I also wanted to get a unit with updated features and that didn't force me to update my speakers since I love them and see no need to replace them at this point.I'm now running this set-upINPUTS:* PS3 Slim* Direct TV HD boxSPEAKERS:* JBL Northridge E30 Front L/R (bi-amped)* JBL ES25CThere are some tweaks that some users may find aggravating to complete or tiresome to test, but that is the nature of the beast. Great sound from existing equipment will always take a bit of time and adjustment to personal taste. I have immensely enjoyed the sound of my new receiver and though I have no problem with Pioneer, I think the new Onkyo is better suited to my needs, tastes, and set-up.TIPS:The feature set of the TX-NR515 is only missing Apple AirPlay, but DLNA is all anyone actually needs. Personal tastes dependent upon the \"cult of Apple\" may dictate the \"need\" for AirPlay and the Onkyo option is theOnkyo UBT-1 Bluetooth USB Adapterwhich allows streaming from an \"i\" device to the receiver. Perosnally, I applaude Onkyo for removing themselves from the addition of $100 to the price of their units to claim \"AirPlay\" like other units with fewer audio benefits but greater gimmicky features. Many PCs and Macs can stream the same content via DLNA, so don't feel compelled to buy an Apple TV or the Bluetooth adapter to be compliant with AirPlay - you don't need it - especially since 'i' devices can plug directly into the front USB with the Apple provided cord.Onkyo has a wifi adapter for the networking to stream internet Radio (sort of redundant if you're just using the receiver for games and movies, and don't have a nice PC speaker setup). The wifi adapter has some connectivity issues when near other networked devices so as is suggested on the wifi adapter page, I ordered the TP-Link TL-WN722N 150Mbps High Gain Wireless USB Adapter for use in lieu of the Onkyo mini USB for the high gain antenna and placement flexibility. The WN722 is the same internal hardware found in the Onkyo adapter. I found that per the suggestion of several other users, this is both better in terms of streaming signal strength and cost efficiency (even with a 9' USB extension cable, the price was less than the Onkyo adapter, at the time of writing this).Unless you're an audiophile with high-end speakers (which then, why a TX-NR515 over an 818 or up?) or just can't get your speakers balanced by ear, Audessey2EQ is moot (but appreciated). I found having to tweak the settings after the alleged \"auto\" set-up, but I did learn a number of things about my set-up in the process and for that, the addition was worth it.PS3 users will notice that the use of \"deep color\" from the PS3 will cause display issues. Be certain to turn the feature off in the PlayStation system settings, as \"deep color\" is mandatory 36-bit colors to conform to the standard and the PlayStation outputs 48-bit, optionally - thus the problem and reason for; Onkyo didn't build the receiver to handle the 48-bit depth, only the 36.The TX-NR515 incorporated HDMI 1.4a, which carries Ethernet and audio return. If your TV does not accept audio return, you'll have to use the TV line out to feed back to the receiver. I would suggest optical out. The PS3 uses HDMI 1.3b-1.4 depending on the model. I suggest the purchase of 1.4a compliant HDMI cables (I got 3 and 6 foot blue rigger) to ensure cable fidelity and signal compliance between legacy devices.The Onkyo remote app is not the most comprehensive or robust app for user but it was intentionally kept simple and straightforward. Additionally, it is a free app. Personal choice was \"O-Remote\" because I can run through every option and set-up for my receiver from my iPhone or iPad, easily and effectively. For the price of an additional $5, I prefer \"o-remote\" on the grounds of flexibility and control.If I had to buy this again, I would... but if the Onkyo has the same build quality as my old Pioneer, my kids will be in college by then and a TX-NR515 will have gone the way of the Dodo.****UPDATE****As an aside, I've no idea why, nor do I much care why - but the network updating feature generally results in no joy across many features. The best method of firmware update is USB. It takes less time, and there are fewer reported errors. After updating, I suggest turning network notification \"off.\" From past experience as a computer tech, when older computers used to have BIOS updates, or for the more modern person, game hardware updates - can result in undesired results. Best bet, sit on the update for two weeks - wait and see if people report issues. If so, wait for resolution before updating. If not, update via USB.Second, apparently HDMI cables are fragile. For some reason, after an update one of my three cooked. It may or may not have been the receiver, but the fact is the cable died. Be prepared to, at times, switch a cable out if there's undesirable result like loss of picture through HDMI out main.Many reports of failing HDMI Main Out can be found on the web. I can't speak for everyone, but after being hit with the same \"issue,\" I discovered a workaround: Order of operation. I turn on my receiver first, then my TV. Because my TV switches resolution, frequency, and \"mode\" which accepting input, it seems to reset and adjust to what the receiver is attempting to hand out.****UPDATE 2****Onkyo has released a USB only firmware update that resolves the HDMI handshake issue. I have updated my 515 and for the past couple of months not run into a single handshake issue and my device performs as expected. Any potential buyers do not need to worry their device will be faulty or that the fix will brick the unit.

It works fine -- as well or better than the Fuji original.I do note, however, that the batteries themselves have three electrodes. The factory original charger also has three electrodes.  But this charger, like most after-market chargers, has only two electrodes.I have read elsewhere that the third electrode in most camera batteries is for temperature monitoring so the charger will know to throttle back if the battery gets too hot.  I don't know if that's the case with the NP-95 battery. I merely mention it here as a noticeable difference from the factory original. Perhaps the manufacturer will explain why it doesn't matter.Best I can tell, this charger works just as well, and just as fast, at a price 60 percent less than the Fuji original. Workmanship is adequate. Certainly no worse than the original, which doesn't impress me either. The electrodes on both are delicate and wouldn't be hard to damage with careless use. And, as others have mentioned, neither grips the battery tightly. This isn't so much an issue with the original, which requires a power cord, and therefore can lie flat on a counter while charging. But with the STK, which plugs directly into a wall outlet, the looser grip might allow the battery to fall out. Keep a rubber band handy :)Aside from being much cheaper, the STK charger has another big advantage over the Fuji original: it's totally self-contained with built-in prongs for the wall socket so you don't have to carry a cord or transformer. And the prongs swivel flat for travel (see photos).On balance -- I don't think this charger would hold up to heavy use, but neither would the original. Both seem rather flimsy.

I simply could not justify the price premium for name plate alone.That said, I have a few quibbles.  I find the sound output \"auto-recognize\" feature to be a little finnicky: if there's no video, the set won't output any sound.  That said, the 4 HDMI inputs and multiple other imput options are a godsend; given my relatively layperson audio needs, I actually use the set as sort of an audio hub, outputting all sound via an optical cable to my home theater receiver (which is severely limited in its inputs).All in all, I feel I've gotten tremendous value for the money.  The picture is bright and wonderfully sharp, and when stations begin to broadcast in true 1080p (as opposed to 1080i at best), the set will continue to pay dividends.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Tremendous value for a future-proof TV", "unixReviewTime": 1194739200, "reviewTime": "11 11, 2007"}

So I read other reviews that said it was a terrible camera, but hey, how bad can it be? I'm sorry to say it is really bad.I know it costs roughly $50 dollars, so it is likely that you wouldn't find any other camera with these features for this price. So I took a chance and yes, it is bad. The images are very blurry, considering that these are bought mostly for kids, and they move the camera a lot while taking pictures. Even an adult will have a hard time taking non-blurry images.Also the batteries die very, and I mean VERY quickly. You will definitely need to carry a lot of AAA batteries and change them every time you want to use it. It is also an annoying fact that when the batteries die you need to adjust the date again, because if you don't, your photos would always be taken in January 1, 2012 at 1 a.m. (that's the date to which it resets). I've also used rechargeable batteries, but they seem to die even faster.Other flaws: the colors on the photos are very different than the real colors, the flash takes A LOT OF TIME to recharge (around 14 seconds is my count) and every time you turn the camera on the flash is off by default, you have to turn it on (maybe to save power on the batteries).My daughter liked it very much at first, now she kind of lost interest a little bit. Maybe because she doesn't like her pictures to be all blurry most of the time.I gave it TWO stars just because it is really waterproof (I've tested at 1.5 meters underwater and had no leaks, yet) and also if you keep extremely still and take pictures with natural light, the photos are fairly ok (with different colors, of course).I don't recommend anyone to buy this product.

The picture was phenomenal, right out of the box.  I'd give this 5 stars, based on the following:PROS:*  VERY nice picture.  Watching NBA and NFL was like putting on glasses for the 1st time.  I immediately noticed details that I've never seen before...and this was just on a 37\" TV!  I've already had 2 friends buy one of these after coming over to see mine.  I can't get enough of the Discovery Channel's HD offerings!  I loved them before, but they are night-and-day better in HD!!!*  GREAT console.  The TV fits nicely in my living room, and has a very attractive black casing.*  VERY nice picture.  It' SO good, I needed to mention it twice!!!*  EASY set up.  The TV is packaged so that you can fasten the base onto the TV without removing it from the foam bumpers.  This prevents the screen from getting scratched while (alternatively) lying it on the floor during installation.  Great packaging!!!*  NICELY laid out jacks.  The TV has 2 HDMI and 3 Component jacks.  One jack has an S-Video-In which takes priority over one set of Components.  The back of the tv is indented and has 2 clips that nestle your input cables and channel them to the lower back-center of the TV.  This will help reduce the clutter behind your TV.CONS:*  Sound.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the sound isn't anything special.  Of course, you'll probably be hooking a TV like this up to a receiver...but if you don't, you won't be overly impressed with the audio.*  Volume.  In a less than ideal environment,(i.e. dishwasher running in the background, spouse talking in the other room...) the max volume setting seems a little low.  Again, this is solved with a receiver, but I would have liked a higher max setting.*  No side inputs.  The gaming version (appx $200 more) has a special gamer-setting, and includes a side input.  I can' imagine that they cost that much, and I feel that at least ONE side-input should have been standard...I love this TV!!!!  I don't know how I put up with standard definition and my old CRT TV!!!  I can confidently recommend this TV to you!!!On a side note, I bought this TV over the 780p model.  In case you're wondering, 'yes' you can tell the difference between 1080p and 780p on this TV!  Pay the extra couple hundred and get the 1080p!!!Also, I plan on using this TV for occasional gaming (Halo 3).  If you're looking for a TV PRIMARILY for gaming, I'd suggest going down to the 32\" 1080p version (LC32D62U or LC32GP1U-gaming)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I love this TV!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1197331200, "reviewTime": "12 11, 2007"}

It was super easy to set up. I plugged into my computer at first and it installed on it's own and was up and running. I work in a Linux OS and I plugged my headset in before booting into my desktop and the headset automatically picked up and all I had to do was change the output to the headset and save the settings. The only con I have is mute. I can't seem to find a mute on this headset and working in a virtual call center-like environment that is a little annoying. I intend on Googling and updating this review with what I find in case someone else is having issues with muting. It's not enough to just lift the boom, so to speak, it needs an actual mute option. Overall I would recommend for anyone with a Windows 7 64 bit system as well as Linux. If you have issues try the following:Windows 7:Plug in the headset. When the headset is plugged in go to your audio options and make sure the Plantronics is what's selected as your input audio and your output audio. Play some music or go to YouTube and the sound should be coming through the headset.Linux:Plug the headset in. Click on Computer and go to Audio.

At 1080p, the image quality with maxed settings was breathtaking! I was so very happy with the quality of picture that I started looking into other ways to really flesh out my purchase. Thus began the assembly of my home theater system...After purchasing speakers, a receiver, and a blu ray player, I found out what I was missing out on. Blu Rays on this TV are just astounding quality! With the whole setup, it is quite the experience. Netflix HD is a must have to enjoy this TV daily unless you want to pay quite a bit for Comcast HD. I find that standard def comcast does of course look rather bad on it, but it will look bad on any HD because it is Standard Definition Signal.The inputs are lacking, this is very true. That is why I went ahead and bought a receiver so that it could handle all of my inputs and adjust them as needed instead of relying on the limits of the TVs settings. When paired with a receiver, this TV as a display is just about perfect to my eyes. It came with no visual defects nor scuffs. It now rests firmly on my wall where it has been mounted for almost a year. If you do plan to mount it, do all the measuring and drilling first and then get a friend or two to help you hang it as it could be dangerous to attempt alone.For the price, I would recommend this TV for just about any setup.

I have a Canon 100mm macro and love it. The AF works reasonably well 50% of the time when shooting in a well lit area. This is good as you can free up one hand to hold a light modifier. The Tamron 180mm, perhaps its a bad copy, doesn't lock the focus with auto.  The 180mm is great because of the added working distance to the subject. Compared to the 100mm macro which works at about 4-6 inches from your subject from the front lens element, the 180mm is closer to 16 inches which is perfect for a flash or reflector to provide more light. I like the way Tamron shifts from auto focus to manual by shifting the focus ring either forward or back. It is convenient versus finding a side switch.  I give it four stars because it's well packaged with the hood, carrying case, and tripod ring and is very sharp when using manual focus.

I am not a wannabe film-maker, just a guy who wants to film children and family activities. For this purpose the Panasonic is excellent and has exceeded all expectations. My old camera is Canon Optura PI, a mini-DV which was top of the prosumer line in its day. The Optura has become unreliable (tapes jam all the time) and the standard-def quality just doesn't look so great anymore. I've been looking at new Canon and Sony models under $1000 but did not really like any of them for various reasons, mostly ergonomics and user interface. But this Panasonic just \"felt right\" from the start. TM60 is the little brother of TM700 that Michael Reichmann reviews at [...] It is small and light, without being too small to handle. Wide angle starts at 37mm (this is very wide for a camcorder without attachments) and 25x optical zoom is very impressive. Optical stabilization is unbelievable - much better than my old Canon, which was the best in its day. I tend to film children following them around the house, or moving the camera around them Matrix-style, and the footage comes out very \"fluid\" without excessive shaking. Video quality is fantastic played directly on the TV through HDMI. It doesn't quite have the blue-ray sharpness, but looks like a good DVD upconverted to 1080. The acid test was shooting trees and flowers in bright sun, with lots of high-contrast edges. My old camera produced and annoying shimmer in these conditions, but with TM60 it is absolutely clean, with sharp detail and no artifacts to speak of. Little things add up. Camera doesn't really need a power switch - it turns on when you open the screen, and turns off when you close it. The lens cover also opens and closes automatically. You can adjust default sharpness, white balance and saturation for video. There is a built-in LED light for shooting in the dark, which is quite effective. There is also a duplicate start-stop button on the left edge of the screen, where you can press it with your left hand. The menu interface is touch-screen which I normally don't like, but this one is much less annoying than Sony's or new Canon's.It comes with Panasonic software for editing AVCHD that is kind of clunky but works OK. Pinnacle 12 handles clips from this camera fairly easily on a dual-core machine.I can think of only 2 downsides of TM60:(1) no microphone input. The camera is completely silent and the built-in mic is surprisingly good, plus the audio level is adjustable, but if you must have external mic then you need to step up to its \"big brother\" TM700.(2) manual focus is technically possible with touch screen buttons, but is not really usable.

The best money can buy. If you're a gamer, this is your set hands down, if you're not a gamer, you could go for cheaper alternatives like plasmas, but why compromise? If you can afford it, buy it. Finest set on the market.  Creme de la creme. Cream of the crop. Period.I purchased this set for my secondary setup. In my dinning room. (My main setup is in my bedroom with the 52\" version of this same set).I only have 1 minor gripe: The remote. Samsung tried literally to reinvent the wheel and failed miserably. For me, this is a non issue, since my dinning room setup is controlled by the satellite box remote but in case you're going to actually use the TV's remote, you should know the remote's functionality with the little wheel is just broken. I didn't consider this small detail a setback important enough to remove any stars from the rating. Doing so would be like buying a 50 million G5 airplane and saying the plane is terrible because you didn't like the cupholders. If the remote happens to be just unbearable for you, any Samsung LCD remote from 3 years ago or newer will work just fine. Just order a replacement remote off ebay for about 20 bukcs and end of story.  For 20 bukcs more you made an almost perfect set, perfect. Done. It's fixable.Have in mind 99% of your hard earned money is going towards picture quality here. And only 1% is going towards the hideous remote. Opt for a different set with a better remote, and there won't be any 20 dollar accessory you can buy off ebay that will get you out of that hole. You will be stuck with sub par picture quality for good. The same goes to people who knock stars off the ratings of TV sets because they don't have good speakers.

Many of the bad reviewers simply don't understand the remote. It has a learning mode that is on by default. Also you would be suprised how many people don't realize that the remote has to be pointed at the device you are trying to control meaning if your devices are say on two sides of the entertainment center, the activity you set up may not work great because it will be trying to turn on say your dvd player on one side, While your pointing at your cable box to turn that off on the other side.This remote has a learning mode that is supposed to help but mostly gets in the way. If it realizes that your are turning things on or off outside of an activity it's AI will try and re-program it's self to more correctly reflect your actions. This feature can be disabled which would alleviate almost all of what people complained about in the poor reviews.This remote is geared toward nerds a little bit. It allows you to program the remote with delay times etc for turning on devices. It allows you to have custom buttons in the display of an activity. You can say make an activity to watch a movie. It will turn on the TV, HT Reciever, Blu-ray, while turning off your cable box. It's great! The remote has to be able to send a signal to those devices though.The remote can learn inputs from ancient remotes simply by pointing the old remote to the back of the logitech, and pushing a few buttons.

I tried an Olympus as that was the brand I use for film, but was not at all happy with their DSLR image quality. As for Canon, I have owned the Rebel 300, 20d and 40d.  The 40d is a great camera and quite usable for the kind of photography I enjoy which is mostly landscape.  I decided to take the plunge and go for a full frame camera despite the price.  I have only used the 5d II about 4 times so far and only twice with the 40d for comparison, but feel pretty confident I can report on the differences.  The 2 cameras are nearly identical in color space and dynamic range not to mention resolution per pixel.  In other words if the image pixel count is the same on both cameras, you would be hard pressed to tell which camera took the picture.  The 5d II just has more pixels.  The 5d II trumps the 40d in several other areas too.* First is the high ISO range; I am very happy with 800-1600 ISO images and I use to only like to settle for ISO 100.* The 24-105L lens becomes a fantastic walk around lens because of the 21mp sensor, images can easily be cropped tight to a distant subject.* My 17-40L is now a true wide angle lens!* Shadows at low ISOs have more depth than the 40d.* Lens micro adjustments can make autofocus nearly perfect.  My 70-300 f5.6 back focuses on both bodies, but I was able to easily correct the issue on the 5d II.  I still have to manually adjust on the 40d.* The back screen is much more usable; I even started using live view mode for some shots.* Because of the resolution and dynamic range RAW images are quite flexible so I don't have to take as many variations.* Multiple resolutions to choose from even in RAW.* Better weather sealing is comforting as I do take the camera to places where it is misty and damp.* I've taken a couple of test movies which look lovely.  I just don't see myself using this feature too often.There is always room for improvement so here is my wish list for the mark III.* An internal flash for filling in shadows.* Frame rate of 5/sec would be nice even though I rarely need it.* The ability to select the range for the auto ISO feature; I'd love to be able to limit the range to 200-800 for certain situations.* A pivoting back display is something that I miss from my old Nikon point and shoot cameras.

I could tell since the inside plastic package had been opened and there was slight dust on the fron element (externally only). Returns scare me but there are a lot of returns for frivolous reasons, so I decided to try this out for 30 days.All I can say is wow! this lens is sharp wide open, high contrast and perfect focus with no microadjust on my 6D.

Light fall-off wide open is there, but almost any software automatically corrects that, and the 6D and other newer bodies correct in camera itself for Jpegs. Same with distortion, its very low and better than most zooms and primes except the true Macro lenses.With a metal mount and nice build, its a no brainer compared to even the plastic fantastic 50 F1.8, which 1 1/3 stop faster and is &#34;toy-like and noisier in its feel&#34;, but that one stop dosent hurt when I can shoot at 6400~12,800 ISO without worrying about noise on the 6D.

Others may love F1.2 etc, not me, I'm just not that artistic enough with razor thin DOF. Bokeh on this lens is equal to lenses costing 5 to 10 times more.What really was nice surpise to me was the 40 mm perspective. As mentioned I believed the 35 and 85 mm focal lenths were more classic and 40 was oddball. Shoot a waist high portrait at 40 mm see what you think with this lens. Its almost like what you see normally and it is a very realistic perspective. I have zoom lenses that do 40 mm but never really shot at 40 mm, for what ever reason.

Only criticism is I wish they could make these waterproof or at least come with a protective covering over the glass.  The only issue with that is that the touch sensitivity on the androids is not as good as the ipads so that might not work out so great.

I bought this for 22 dollars and expected some issues.  My last one required you to have the KVM active on the computer you wanted to start up from the very beginning of the power-up until the machine had been fully loaded.  This one does not require that.Three USB plugs on the KVM make things easy to have a couple of mice.  The extra USB(s) is actually useful for using the KVM as a jump drive hub.  The neat thing is the USB becomes shared and is available to which ever computer is active on the KVM.  I was surprised.  I gave it 4 stars because it acted up one time (Details to solve below).  The button on the KVM jumps around to a port that is not the next consecutive one some times instead of always going to the next port (1 to 2 to 3, etc), but the light is pretty visible and you can keep track of which computer is which, right?Pros:-Cheap and comes with all four cables (I am surprised it is so cheap)-You don't have to be on the active computer with the KVM when you boot up a computer for the mouse to work (USB is wonderful)-4 ports-3 USB ports, which you can use with jump drives to share and don't have to pull out the drive and put in another computerCons:-Couldn't figure out any hot keys to switch ports (I tried all four major ones, no luck) so you need to keep it available-Button to switch computer jumps ports some times.  It means you have to look at the light once every 4 times or so keep it visible-One issue with it in 5 months-Keyboard and mouse can take ~1 second to be recognized, not long but noticable if you are doing a lot of switching-USB 1.1 on the jump drive transfer rate (not good enough for a 1TB external disk although it works)Result:Much cheaper then the big boys like IOGEAR, I would buy it again.To solve the issue for NR-401US,Description:I plugged in a new laptop, and the new laptop didn't recognize the keyboard USB driver.  Make a note of this warning and see below how to fix it.  This caused the keyboard to quit working on all computers through the KVM. Bummer.  There is no help using google search to solve the problem.Solution:I unplugged all the USB plugs on the KVM.  Left it like this for 2 minutes (more than enough to fix).  Still not working.  I plugged in the USB ports on all the computers but the new one, and left the new laptop unplugged.  I booted up the computer on port 1, the mouse and keyboard worked.  I did the same on computer 3, no problem.  I didn't bother with port 2 and plugged in the new computer display and USB.  I then booted up the new laptop and no problem, it worked.Maybe the problem was I started to boot up a new computer without plugging in the display first, as I was so used to booting up computers with them not being active.

When they were making it the finishing around the edges is roughshod and uneven. On the nook case it is very even and the outside covering completely covers over the edges whereas this case it does not.  The lip when you close the case does not go over the bottom edge, so while it does close it doesn't completely close.I do have to say that despite the shoddy finish workmanship, this is a nice case which doesn't add much weight overall. I love the hand strap cases. The only thing I would add to this case would be the second strap to hold the cover in place when it is turned back in the reading position.

My job is in sports, fitness, and recreation and I find a lot of uses for this device. When I map out road races participants are always impressed at the amount of information I can give them concerning courses including elevation gains / profiles and very precise measurements. So getting the devices has paid off big time for me when it comes to work. Personally I also use the device a lot because I normally mount it to my bike when I ride to work and am out and about. The GPS gives me more information that any car dashboard could offer. The only drawback for me is the fact that I live in a foreign country (Asia) and Garmin does not make any maps for where I live. Even so there are ways around it (creative third party vendors). Even still it's hard to get maps if you are outside of US or Europe. Bottom line:1. Good Reception2. Feels good in your hand3.

Admittedly, it's a bit like saying \"That's the most enjoyable injection the doctor has ever given me\", but these are extremely comfortable.  The clarity and lifelike nature of the 3D images is intoxicating, particularly with Tron Legacy and Mortal Kombat (admittedly, we're not dealing with a deep bench here in terms of content, so hopefully there will be more stuff on the way).Funtionally, pairing them with the TV was effortless (I think my bluetooth mouse was more work) and they are completely automated after that...the TV knows when you are watching 3D-enabled content and wearing the glasses...if you take them off to set them down and stroll in the other room to get a glass of water, it even seems to sense this and put the glasses to sleep and disengage the 3D display.  It's pretty cool if you ask me.We have tried roughly half of the 3D stuff we could get our mits on, video games, blu ray, and VOD/PPV and free stuff via DirecTV.  It looks great (better in my home than in any demo kiosk I've seen anywhere, actually).  It somehow makes the image not just come *out* of the TV, but (as it should) presents the impression that the TV is many times deeper, and that you are actually peering INTO a 3D world, rather than simply watching it bulge out nearer to your face from the screen.  Given the current state of technology and the price point of these, I think I would give these 5 stars.However, I ding two stars as I bought these SPECIFICALLY because to my knowledge no other model on the market allows for my prescription to be installed into the lenses.  Though comfortable, they are not particularly glasses-friendly.  They don't sit properly on my face and tend to skew away from the nose unevenly when I have my regular glasses on underneath, making the picture a bit contorted (I don't think this has anything to do with the 3d glasses themselves per se, but rather just how they sort of fit snugly and therefore are fighting with my regular glasses for pole position on my face).  They say \"prescription ready\"--and that's about all the website says.  Registering them was no help ... in fact, after registering them, the first question someone else on Samsung's website had posted was \"How do I order prescription lenses for these?\" and it had 0 responses.The documenation says to check the Samsung website (Wow ... I mean really!).  I was unable to send an e-mail as their support requests/contact interfaces are all forms-based, and these glasses (much like my new TV) are not available from the drop downs yet ... at least not for support.  I called Samsung and they told me to take them to an optometrist.  I contacted three optometrists, and none could do this for me (only one knew what active shutter glasses even were) and suggested I contact the manufacturer (yea, well...).  I went to Best Buy and they hadn't even heard of the prescription ready option yet.  I called Samsung back and they repeated what their screens must have been saying, \"take the glases to an optometrist.\"  When I explained the optometrist was unable to help they said they couldn't help me beyond that--no means of escalation or direct contact with Samsung.As of May, 2011, this is still not just a newer technology, but this is a very new product and the only one available (to my knowledge) boasting a prescription-ready lense.  I am imagining that I will have to send these in to Samsung (or a delegated partner) at some point, pay an additional fee, wait a period of time, and then have them shipped back.  I just wish someone could acknlowledge that this is even a possibility.  By the time all that happens, I'll have a new presciption...Until then ... three stars for you!**UPDATE MAY 23, 2011**I finally reached Samsung on a different troubleshooting line, and they put me on hold for about ten minutes then suggested I go to a Hoya Vision website ... I don't think I can put links in here but will try ... effectively, Samsung has partnered with Hoya Vision to provide lenses for these units, and only certain optometrists are set up for this branded style/type of lens creation.  So far, I have been waiting 4 days for a response from one of the local Hoya shops I called.  They know what the technology is, but have never heard of 3D glasses taking prescription lenses, and so also do not know how it will be done or how much it will cost me.Go to the Hoya Vision website, then click \"FIND A HOYA EXPERT\" in order to find one locally.  Here is the link (if it works):[...]**UPDATE MAY 27, 2011**So I contacted a local Hoya dealer, and they didn't know what I was talking about.  They said they would call me back but didn't, so I called them back after a few days and they said I was supposed to have heard back from a Hoya rep (though I had not).  They said they would call him again.  A day later I got a call from the Hoya rep, explaining how crazy things have been lately (yadda yadda) but that he would be getting back to me with pricing and implementation information--though oddly he asked me about the glasses--are they active shutter?  Or passive/polarized (always troubling to have to fill in product reps on the product they represent).  I told him these are active shutter/LCD glasses and he said he would call me back shortly.  That was earlier this week, and it's now friday.Still no word ... though I must say, the fact that these are advertised as \"prescription ready\" when they are actually \"clip on ready\" makes me contemplate calling foul--my face is prescrption ready, then too.  I think I may file some complaints about false advertsising.  This claim led me to spend thousands on a product that does not deliver what it purports to do.  The fact that I am otherwise satisfied with the product itself does not excuse the fact that misleading advertising was used to sell it to me--and certainly does not change the fact that the key feature I was intrigued by may be a false claim.  However, as I still (a week later) have received no definitive information on how this is done, I still am not sure if I have been duped or not.**UPDATE JUNE 8, 2011**Though I did hear from a Hoya product/field rep over a week ago, and he was working on this, I still have not heard back.  I contacted the area dealer again and they had my paperwork right there--they are contacting the rep again for me.  Still no way to know how to get the Rx into the lens.  Signs keep indicating it won't be \"into\" the lens--but clipped or adhered onto it.  If this had been more clearly laid out beforehand, I probably wouldn't have bought these or the Samsung TV in the first place.  I'm considering filing some complaints since the product is making claims no one can keep--and it's set me back over $3,000 at this point.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "I can't see clearly now", "unixReviewTime": 1305849600, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2011"}

Scott", "helpful": [16, 17], "reviewText": "My husband got this as a birthday present for me because he wanted me to have Bluetooth phone, and he knew I would instantly turn the display pink.  I was a little skeptical that I even needed a new car stereo (I was perfectly happy with my original one, and I rarely use the phone in the car), but I like a cool new gadget as much as anyone.Now that I've had my 8500 installed for a few months, I wonder how I did without it.INSTALLATIONI consider it pretty complicated to install a car stereo.  There are lots and lots (and lots) of wires to match up, and there are things you need to buy (like the enclosure that fits around the stereo, and, for my car, we needed an adapter to hook up the antenna).  I absolutely wouldn't have even tried this on my own.  But my husband didn't bat an eye.  He thought the installation was very straightforward.SOUNDThe sound is excellent. I thought the sound on my old system was good, but this blows it away.  There is much more \"presence\" without necessarily being louder.  If you like a deep, window-rattling bass, you can get that (no need for new speakers!), but for those of us who prefer a more balanced sound, it comes shipped at that setting.  There are lots of ways (maybe even too many) to customize the sound, so however you like it, and whatever genre you listen to, this Pioneer has you covered.DISPLAY & FEATURESThe colors are beautiful.  And yeah, I went with an all pink display.  Then I tinkered with having half of it lavender.  Then I turned it blue and red for Independence Day.  Can't wait to do green and red for Christmas.  Can't decide?  You can set the colors to slowly cycle through (they gradually morph from one to the next).  You can also set the colors to match the other lights on your instrument panel, no matter what they are.Unfortunately, the display is not very easy to read.  It's too dim during the day, and the dots of color are too big to make the characters clear even under the best of circumstances.  When the unit is on, under most display options the clock is so tiny that it is extremely difficult to read (and who wants to be leaning over and squinting at the darn thing while driving?).When using Pandora, if you choose to display both the artist and the song title, it forces you to give up the clock altogether and instead displays which station you are listening to. I finally got around this bit of idiocy by specifying that my default display be a large clock (which also includes the date; you can't choose to display only the clock).  By pressing the \"back\" button, I can see what the artist and song title are, if I wish.  But this whole thing just wasn't well thought out.Despite being too dim during the day, the display is too bright at night.  You can set it to dim when the headlights are turned on, but it makes very little difference.  This hasn't been a huge issue for me yet, but I don't do much night driving.Mixtrax is a joke.  It only works when playing songs from USB.  And why would I want my songs blended together, anyway?  The lighting show it's supposed to create synchronized to the music might be kind of cool as a novelty, but I doubt it's something I'd pay attention to after the first couple of songs (and you probably shouldn't be watching it while you're driving, anyway!).Speaking of Pandora, I absolutely LOVE listening to it on this thing.  It's easy to skip a song (you flick a lever) and to give a song a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down.  Changing stations is fairly easy, too (push one button to bring up your stations, then turn the volume dial to scroll them them, then push the volume dial to make your selection).PHONEThe phone function work GREAT.  The sound is excellent (both what you hear and what the other person hears; I have my mic attached to my steering column).  When you get a call, it doesn't just mute your music, it actually PAUSES it.  It makes a distinct, non-alarming series of notes to let you know a call is coming in.  You answer the phone by pushing a small, but clearly marked, button.  You push the same button again to hang up, and after a moment, your music will resume.  Making a call is a bit more complicated, but I do actually find it much easier than picking up my phone, even if I'm not driving.The Bluetooth connection for the phone works easily and smoothly.  Shortly after I start my car, I always hear a little beep to indicate that it has connected with my phone.  Once I paired the two the first time, they have never failed to pair on their own.  Even when I got a new car battery and the system was without power for several hours, it remembered my phone (some of my other settings were lost, including turning on Pandora, which is a pain to do, but at least my phone worked!).BLUETOOTHAside from the phone, using other apps via Bluetooth has been a bit spotty, at least when first turning them on.  Even though my phone pairs right away, the Pandora app on my phone doesn't work until I push the \"try again\" button on the stereo at least once (sometimes multiple times).  If I want to listen to music during a particular drive, I make sure I have Pandora going before I start driving.Once I get everything working, I can also listen to music via my phone apps for Rhapsody, Amazon, and my phone's native music player.  The song information for these apps isn't displayed on the stereo.Despite the slight hassle in getting things going, once they ARE going, the Bluetooth connection works great.  The stereo has never lost contact with my phone.CONTROLSThe controls are not at all intuitive, and most functions are extremely difficult to locate.  Every time I want to do something I don't do on a regular basis, I have to look it up in the very low-quality, poorly organized, difficult-to-follow owner's manual.To turn the stereo off, you have to push in and HOLD the \"Source\" button for several seconds until the display changes (yeah, I want to be watching my stereo for several seconds while driving).  If you let go too soon, it will change the source, instead, which, in my case, results in the tuner coming on, which is MUCH louder than Pandora, and, because I don't get good radio reception where I live, it's typically static.  I hate it when that happens!  I so much wish there was just a simple, dedicated power button.The radio does not have dedicated preset buttons, either.  You have to push multiple buttons to access your presets, then scroll through the display of them.  This is not something I would really want to do while driving.The initial set-up of the system (time, date) goes easily enough (it walks you through it automatically the first time you turn on the stereo), but changing anything else will probably require looking in that black pit of an owner's manual.Are you starting to get the idea that the controls are the worst aspect of this system?SUMMARYDespite its extensive design flaws, I really do like this system, anyway.  It's great for Pandora, the sound is fantastic, I love the pretty colors, and the phone works great.  These items were top priorities for me.  Because of the poor reception in our area, the radio functions aren't important to me.  But if your priorities include easily changing the radio station, this unit probably wouldn't be a good choice for you.  Nor would it be if simplicity and ease of use are paramount to you.  But if Pandora and the phone are all you care about, this is a solid choice.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great sound, awful controls", "unixReviewTime": 1374537600, "reviewTime": "07 23, 2013"}

I just had to tighten one of the adjusting screws a bit, and the problem was solved. (The documentation included with the LX shows how to do this, and the appropriate hex wrench is included.) The LX does accommodate 27\" monitors without a problem, but they will tend to be at the high end of its acceptable weight range.Being able to move the monitor wherever it suits me is absolutely wonderful.

As time has passed, I find that I use it less and less, because I can almost always get better results with something else.I have often found a kind of harsh contrast to the photographs I take with this lens. When using it, I have to be particularly diligent about lighting as a result. Zoom is convenient for composing but the camera is not optimal for controlling distracting backgrounds; this lens is certainly not appropriate for portraits.Only once did I get pictures with this lens that were much better than I expected, when handheld photos at maximum zoom on slow film in a dark temple came out perfectly. That's entirely a credit to the image stabilizer.Nowadays, I regard this as a snapshot lens; as such, it's often superseded by a point-and-shoot camera which takes pictures almost as well and is a lot easier to carry around.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Useful but not a great or special lens", "unixReviewTime": 1204502400, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2008"}

I'm a little late on my review, but I felt these little guys deserved some additional vouching for. This review comes as a result of me searching for a replacement for them, something a bit more mobile--seems to be a lot out there now. After some research I decided to try the X-Mini Max II and while it was alright, it was defective out the package. I heard only one of its speakers, and it was pretty decent, but would not be able to touch the Boomtube Ex. The only thing it had on the Boomtube was its portability--1/3 the size. I guess the other thing it could have possibly had is battery life(playing time). Regardless, that unit was defective and is gone!The first and foremost thing to note is, this Boomtube is functioning like the day it did when I pulled it out the packaging nearly 6 years ago--besides that unworthy crappy 3.5mm cable it came bundled with. It still looks and sounds great like the other happy reviewers posted. Yes, even the battery life appears to be nearly the same averaging 4-6 hours depending on volume.Just yesterday I decided to take it all apart to clean and feed my curiosity. Although it's stamped with \"Made in China\", nothing about it's design and assembly suggested \"value engineering\". The more I got to disassembling the more apparent it became that a lot of thought went into its creation. The speakers were encased in a neat looking \"basket\" like that of cool looking sub-woofers. All of them had a rubber gasket between speaker and casing. They had some pretty large and heavily soldered terminals to them as well. Inside the base portion, behind the sub-woofer, lay the PCB. I didn't get to pulling that out, but what I could see on it were two little aluminum heat sunken boxes. My speculation was that they were the amplifiers for the satellite speakers and the subs, however, it may have simply been what >>I&lt;&lt; wanted those little heat sunken boxes to be(lol!). I live by the slogan \"I void warranties\" so I've taken apart tons of stuff before and I was truly impressed with the design, technology, and quality of material gone into this little system.Couple things it could use: 1) A protected power button so not to accidentally turn the unit on in transport and 2) stainless steel exterior screws to avoid rusting(lots of beach use here).In regards to the statement in parenthesis in #2, \"lots of beach use here\", that just suggests its capability to play in open air with waves pounding and people sitting around conversing. It plays pretty loud. I really noticed it when we were doing some irrigation at our church and I found myself turning down the unit as I was about 40yds away, farthest in the group, and I could hear it loud and clear and I remember thinking \"it must be a little loud for them\" as I watched those that were closer talk over the playing music.In conclusion, I'm extremely happy I picked these up. And I forgot to mention that I picked these up after buying, then returning, my Bose Companion speakers(was not impressed) Despite having always used them to some extent, I've since found a new appreciation--enjoying my Boomtue EX.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Still going...............", "unixReviewTime": 1316390400, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2011"}

The specs were very similar when i bought this. I went with the Kindle for three reasons - memory capacity, amazon prime videos, and ability to root to install Google apps. Now that the Nexus 7 comes with 16GB at the same price, it's the clear winner and wish I could go back and switch.The Fire runs Android, sorta. Amazon's skin is so customized you'd never know it was Android. The UI is slow and clunky and out of the box you only get Amazon's app store. I can get over those. It's also pretty buggy. The screen cailbration was always off and even most of the default apps just hung or crashed frequently. Downloading some sort of task killer is an absolute must. I rooted and installed the Google Play store. The root I did was not a full root but I got an instant perfromance boost. Apps still lag and crash pretty frequently, but less so now. One of my deciding factors was I thought I could get the best of both worlds. This is only sort of true. Many apps are just not compatible with the Fire even when you have the Play store installed. I was able to get flash working pretty well. Gmail, YouTube, and dolphin browser all work fine. Replacing the default keyboard is pretty challenging and requires an additional app. SwitftKey works ok but not perfect. I may try to get a full root and just completely replace the ROM if a stable one is available.The only advantage this tablet now has is the video store. Buying this tablet started my free trial with Prime. I thought Amazon would regularly update and add new selections, but free videos are very limited and mostly consists of tv shows. Now the video feature is an ok option and I use it, but it is not worth the trade off of having a fully functioning tablet.Speaking of which, the video app frequently crashes and can be very laggy. Once the video starts performance is fine, but navigating around the video store is painfully slow and where the crashes most frequently occur. The web interface on my computer for videos is a little slow and buggy in many of the same ways, but not as bad as on the fire.I try to keep a clean tablet with only the apps i use frequently. I keep the half the memory free at any time, The biggest downfall of the Kindle Fire is the enormous burden of bloatware. Even with an task killer, there are at least 10 apps that I never use that instantly re-open. The Fire only allocates about 350MB for working memory. The unkillable apps suck up about a third of that. A better task killer or additional tweaks could improve performance significantly. Even options like preventing the book, web, email and video apps from auto starting would help tremendously.as frustrating as it is, the Fire has a great HD screen and I still use it almost daily. Battery life is pretty good, but I am already starting to see a decreased capacity. 99% of the packaging was recyclable so that was a bonus. Mine didn't come with a wall plug which i thought was actually good. I could have even skipped the micro usb cord it did come with too. They come with every other device and phone already and would just sit in a drawer. Once you turn off the ads in the UI you only see them in the lock screen so giving Amazon an extra $15 or so to remove them entirely is totally unnecessary. With enough tweaks, it's a decent tablet, but the nexus 7 can do almost everything the Fire can do plus much much more. I cannot recommend the Fire HD unless you really cannot live without the prime video app. If that's the case, you'll still be disappointed in the performance of this feature.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "even rooted, very limited options for apps. regret not going with Nexus 7", "unixReviewTime": 1366761600, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2013"}

Matheny", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I've been eyeing this device purely for the parental controls for the last 2-3 years, but I finally laid down the cash to pick one up a couple of weeks ago when my daughter got an iPod Touch.  At that point I decided that the PC-based parental controls were no longer sufficient since I wouldn't be able to filter any new non-PC devices on the network with them.Anyway, I ordered the DSD-150 and expected to just plug it into the network and configure it.  I've read other users complain about the setup process, but I didn't think that would really apply to me because of my networking background.  I won't go into the trouble-shooting details; except to say that it took several hours a day over a 3 day period to finally get this device working.  I probably spent 5-6 hours on the phone with the bsecure support people and I have to admit that they have great tech support (no wait times and very knowledgeable people based in Florida).  It was due to their help that I was finally able to get this working.As far as the functionality goes, this device does exactly what they advertise.  I have it configured to use just the parental controls, parental reporting, and firewall - and I've been impressed with the parental control feature.  It has over 80 different categories that you can either allow or block, and there is a parental override password if you need to get to something that is blocked.  If someone tries to access blocked content, you can configure it to send you an e-mail or a text to let you know what was tried.  The great thing about a hardware filter is that I can lock it in my wiring closet and be sure that everything in the house is automatically filtered!It may seem like I'm rating the DSD-150 kind of high based on the install problems I had, but I'm basing that on the bsecure tech support as well as the functionality of the device once it was configured.  I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the setup issues.For people who are using AT&T; uVerse for their Internet, here is the solution to my problem: it turns out the DSD-150 would not connect when using a non-routable/local subnet DNS address.  I use the AT&T; uVerse service and it gives my router a routable IP address and gateway with the non-routable address of the uVerse box as a DNS server.  The solution was to configure the device with all static IP info, even though I get a dynamic address from my ISP (AT&T;) - now I'll have to update the DSD-150 configuration every time I get a new IP address (but thankfully that isn't very often according my dyndns logs).One more helpful tip that isn't documented for the DSD-150, is that the configuration IP address is [...].  The username is admin and the default password is blank (although both those can be changed).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works as advertised (after painful setup process)", "unixReviewTime": 1253491200, "reviewTime": "09 21, 2009"}

Moran \"Computer+History/Politics\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Age and injuries have increased the range of situations where I can't adequate stabilize a camera in the position that the picture demands, and myJoby GP1 Gorillapodhas been a major aid. I was looking for a second tripod in this category to cache away for when I hadn't pocketed the Gorillapod.I often wrap my Gorillapod around a railing, post, tree branch, ... This tripod is substantially inferior for these uses because the pivot joints (vs ball joints) do not allow the legs to be as closely contoured to such objects. Because there is less contact with the object, there is less friction to hold the tripod in place. In many situations it slipped easily.I also use my Gorillapod to get low-angle shots, and I can flatten it all the way to the ground, boulder, whatever. This tripod has roughly a 3-inch gap between the top of the legs and the ground.The picture of this tripod shows flat feet vs the Gorillapod's ball feet, and I thought this would be an advantage on flat surfaces. However, the joint on the foot does not have enough adjustment range when the legs are spread a normal degree. And the bottom pivot turns not toward the center of the tripod, but tangentially. Thus, you must use the second pivot point to get the feet flat. Not a significant functional difference, but it is jarring to me (an engineer).With the Gorillapod, the quick release attachment on the camera is 1/8-inch thick flat plate, which I find to be barely noticeable. The corresponding attachment here is 3/8-inch tall cylinder with a bottom disk that seems to always be snagging things. Additionally, the quick release feature is not documented. That rod that looks like a handle that you use on a full-sized tripod to position the camera is instead something you pull to release the attachment. If you attempt to use it to move the camera through the ball head range, you are likely to break it.I did find this tripod's ball head a decided advantage over the head on the Gorillapod in situations where I had wrapped the legs of the tripod around another object. However, the better holding abilities of the Gorillapod would seem to more than offset this in most of these situations.This tripod is a bit larger than the corresponding Gorillapod in length, diameter and weight, and I initially didn't think it would matter.

I had bad experiences with quality from Skullcandy's in-ear headphones (even the more expensive ones). I decided to give them a try because I really like the style and the color, plus the many reviews that appeared in several places. Now, I do own several brands like Bose, Beats, Sony and Seinnheiser, in many styles (in-ear, over-ear, etc.), and I consider myself a picky music listener. These are some impressions on these Aviators so far:LOOKS: 9 -At first, it took a moment to get used to the style but, after many compliments, I wear them now with pride.COMFORT: 8 -While they feel very soft and snug, after a couple of hours my ears start to feel hot and, since I wear glasses, they start to dig in because of the preassure (usually I do not wear headsets for that long). They are not heavy at all.CONSTRUCTION: 7 -The Aviators look sturdy enough (stainless steel over heavy leather headband). However, the finish on the earcups and the golden finish of the head support make me nervous. They look very prone to scratching. The support wiring for the headband feels like it would not take much bending. Only time (and care) will tell. The Mic3 cord is made of a nylon material and seems strong enough. My problem is that the cord itself creates audible feedback when rubbed againts something like your jacket. It's very annoying. The Mic3 seems made of cheap plastic, but the controls feel responsive.PORTABILITY: 7 -These headsets come with a very nice, good quality carrying bag. The Aviators fit very snug, although it can be difficult to put them in and take them out. Unfortunately, it is kind of a big fit to stash in a backpack or carrying them around, and if you do not use the pouch, they can easily get scratched.SOUND QUALITY: 10  -This is by far the most important aspect for me. I did break in the 40mm drivers for 40+ hours. I must say that the sound reproduction is excellent. The highs, mids and lows show up very clear. These headsets made me want to listen to my library again. From classical to pop, hip-pop, R&B;, rock and electronic music, the instruments, vocals, drums, bass, etc., were very distinctive. The bass may be lacking for people who love it, but for me, it was strong enough without being overbearing and the highs did not &#34;bleed&#34; over the the lows and mids.PRICE: 9 -Overall, I recommend these.

Not a good sign. While it did work, the volume/power knob did not switch the unit on or off and did not alter the volume. It does light up with its nice yellow glow, however. It would be a solid three stars if not for that.It connected easily to the Windows XP computer I tested it on, and played right away with no need to tweak any computer settings (except volume). The sound quality is not bad for such small speakers, and for most people it would probably be adequate. It is definitely a step up from the \"standard\" speakers that come with most new computers. It was very crisp and clear in the mid and high ranges, but a little weak in the bass range,  which is understandable for small speakers. It takes a certain sized cone to move enough air for adequate bass response, and that doesn't happen until you get to 5 or 6 inch speakers, in my opinion, unless exotic cabinet designs are used.It was nice that they included a USB extension cable as the main cable is quite short. I did not try the USB hub for speed or function, as my time on the test machine was limited. The USB ports are pretty close together, which means you would most likely need more extension cables.The instructions are on a foldout page with multiple languages in each section. The directions were minimal but adequate, and I would have liked more detail about the construction and function of the unit. (Like the vendor was actually proud of it.) The power cord is about 5 feet long or so, and connects easily on both ends. The construction was pretty good for something like this, and felt very solid. It is stylish and will appeal to those for whom looks are important.While the sound was okay for computer speakers (I run my computer audio through a full 120 watt stereo system with 8 inch three way speakers, and have used 12 inch three way systems as well, so I am used to very good sound), I am not sure about the viability of this design. It is useful as a desktop speaker setup, but I wouldn't consider it very travel friendly, as it is not small. (A little bit smaller than three 18 inch aluminum foil boxes stacked together, two on the bottom with one on top.) However, it is one unit with only two wires, and that will appeal to some who get tired of the rat's nest of wires needed for separate speakers. Then again, one won't have the flexibility of placement that one would get with separate speakers. That trade-off is a personal decision.I also have serious questions about the functionality of using a computer to stand in for a much cheaper CD/mp3 player. While there are certainly computer audio uses (it might be great if you view video/movie files on your computer), I think that its actual usefulness is rather narrow. Headphones give greater privacy and portability, and a larger sound system would be more desirable for a fixed location.Also, it only takes audio over USB from your computer, so you can't use it for any devices other than a computer (for now at least). I would rate it higher if there were analog inputs for a CD or mp3 player. I also question the wisdom of using USB bus bandwidth for something that could easily be handled by the audio card and its dedicated ports (which is on and drawing power anyway). The idea that it is \"digital sound\" is pure marketing hype, as the sound will get converted from digital to analog one way or another before it goes to the speakers - either in your audio card or in this device's amp. These speakers have no advantage there.There are other devices out there that would do the audio portion of what this speaker does, as well or better. My preference would be a separate USB hub and a more versatile audio amp and speakers. For travel purposes, it is definitely too large and requires AC power (it is not powered by the USB line). I think this is more of a gimmick than a really useful item, but I'm sure there are those for whom it will work really well.I would advise really thinking about your audio needs carefully and researching well before you decide on this unit.

My two Bose CD/Radio players are still rockin' it out and the batteries (15 years old!)in the remote controls are the original ones. Now THAT'S quality.Including the above, I also own the original Bose Soundlink ($300) and Bose Soundlink Mini ($200), both of which I paid for directly from Bose. In addition, I also have 6 other Bluetooth speakers, through Vine.Which brings me back to THIS Bose speaker. I waffled between 3 or 4 stars for days, and finally decided that the Bose reputation demanded the four stars. Now, WHY 4 stars? It just seems that Bose is falling behind other companies, and resting too heavily on it's laurels rather then trying to upgrade their products. For $300.00, which places this speaker in the upper range of most people's budgets, I feel that the less expensive but superior Bose Soundlink Mini delivers more \"Bang For Your Buck\", and saves you an extra $100.00, to boot!TheBose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker, is far smaller, lighter (1.5 pounds vs. 3 pounds for this speaker) and to my ears, a crisper/lighter sound. I've tried adjusting the bass through my app equalizer but the bass is just overwhelming to my ears. The Mini is also a wonderful speaker to travel with because of the much smaller size and weight. My original Soundlink was bought for traveling, but the weight proved to my sore shoulders that it needed to stay home, on the desk!Since three years ago, I've bought and tried over 6 other brands of Bluetooth speakers: Some, for home enjoyment and some, for working at an outdoor job site. I finally settled upon theiLuv MobiAria NFC-Enabled Bluetooth Speaker with USB Charging Portfor my Home-use only speaker and theSimple Audio Go Compact Rechargeable Bluetooth Speaker (90B0001-US)for using outdoors. My Soundlink Mini stays INDOORS, in hotels and spas with me.So, now down to the nitty-gritty of \"WHY?\" did I give this speaker, four vs. five stars, which is still a high rating, in my book.Well, as a consumer, YOU must decide first and foremost: Will THIS Bose speaker or ANY Bluetooth speaker be the ONE & ONLY speaker that you own? Will THIS speaker be the one that greets you with music when you first wake up? Then, it transitions to a day at the beach or work site? Will you take only THIS speaker with you on holiday? If the answer is \"Yes!\" to all of these questions, than you'll probably love this 3rd generation of Bose Soundlink.But, if you decide that for the sum of $300.00, you'd like a speaker that sounds FANTASTIC in your home but a smaller, lighter, less expensive speaker for playing outside and traveling, then I don't recommend this speaker for your needs.This is why:1) Most of my newer Bluetooth speakers have \"Voice Guidance\" which I've come to really appreciate. They will state in male or female voices, \"Discovering device\", \"Device connected\", and/or \"Good Bye\" or \"Device removed\" when the Bluetooth connection is shut off.  I own $50 speakers and $300 speakers that have Voice Prompt; none of my Bose speakers have that feature.2)Touch screen panels. LOVE them! The iLuv MobiAria NFC-Enabled Bluetooth Speaker with USB Charging Port ($111.00) has a gorgeous, smooth, glass-like control panel that is completely touch controlled; no buttons to press/depress/or more importantly, have dust and pet fur get trapped between the controls. The Bose speaker has buttons that are covered, so cleaning is easier, but you still have that less than fun function to deal with of touch vs. depressing the buttons.A nice touch on the iLuv is an actual USB charging port in back, so you can keep your device plugged in and always ready to use without a drained battery.3) Less Bass, More Treble! I don't know if it's because of age or what, but I just can't handle bass-heavy speakers any longer; it's just either painful or I can't literally hear the music any longer. Same goes for my husband. No matter what equalizer app we use on our tablet/smartphone, we just can't eliminate the bass heavy Bose sound in this speaker. In my other speakers, including the Bose Mini, there's better balance and far less bass.4) Then there's the theft factor and your safety. With over 40% of the nation's thefts related to cell phones, in good conscience, I would NEVER bring such a LARGE TARGET as this speaker to an outdoor space to enjoy listening to music outside. Sure, in the safety of my back yard, on the deck, or at a friend's place, I'd feel safe. But a large, $300.00 speaker just BEGS a thief to \"invite\" themselves to your event. There are far less expensive great speakers designed expressly to be used outdoors that I would strongly suggest buying and using in public areas.So, this is what it boils down to: $300 (Soundlink III) vs. $200.00 (Soundlink Mini) vs. $111 (iLuv-NOT portable) vs. $81.00 (Simple Go Audio)....where do YOU want to spend your money? For the cost of THIS speaker, I can buy the Mini and either the iLuv or Simple Go, ending up with a kick arse home speaker and a kick arse traveling speaker for almost the same price.  Only your wallet and your ears can make that decision. If there's one thing I've learned in life it's this: You'll NEVER convince someone that YOUR coffee brand or speaker choice is the right one!  Some like it Dark Roast, some like it Light. Some like it Bass Heavy, some like it Light.So, I'm giving this speaker a 4 Star ranking for the name \"Bose\", the quality of the product but deducting a star for the excessive bass and my opinion that THIS Bose speaker just doesn't seem as \"up to date\" as other speakers I own, including their very own other product, the Soundlink Mini.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Close, but No Cigar. :(", "unixReviewTime": 1393804800, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2014"}

I have a lot of time spent with it and like to review things if I can after serious use, not 2 days when I'm still in the honeymoon phase.I'll start with the keyboard - This is why I initially and only wanted this set to begin with.  I can type pretty well but the regular office keyboards will cause me to get carpal issues before I'm 40 if I keep using them.  I also cannot stand the split in half ergonomic keyboards either.  I was happy when I started to see this style released (MS has some now too that are pretty cheap and so so as do others).  The keys are spaced well, the layout works just as well as a regular keyboard that I learned to type on.  It has helped with my wrists and hands not hurting greatly.  I haven't had an issues using the keyboard.  The one complaint I'll say about it is the fact the calculator is right next to the power key.  I love the calc key (used it on other keyboards) and I've never had a keyboard with a power key until this one.  I've only done it twice, but I've accidently pushed power off instead of the calc key.  Put a power key by itself - not next to a frequently used key.Next up is the mouse - I wanted to like it and use it, but two major things kept me from using it often.  The first and most annoying is with batteries in this sucker, it's heavy.  I'm a big guy and all that, but I don't want to be pushing a rock around on my desk daily.  At work I go between 2 screens and large stuff, so flinging this mouse is a challenge.  The second thing are the buttons on the side.  Once again, I'm a big guy and this trend of smaller buttons frustrates me to no end.  I hated using them and I find if I don't have good side buttons on a mouse, I don't use it.  So, I've tried using the mouse here and there when I had to move and set-up my stuff again, but within a few weeks I put it away.  It also just isn't the best sensor or anything else.  Overall it's a so-so bare bones mouse that works, but you can do much better.Final impressions are generally positive.  The keyboard is the shining light of this set, the mouse is bare useable to me.  Other things are the receiver works well and everything connects without issues.  The battery life is stellar for both the board and mouse.  I don't know if I'd believe 3 years for the board, as over 2 years I've had to replace them once, but that's really good to me anyway.

I hate that crap too. But all you need to do is buy DVD + R's from any store and they should work- JUST REMEMBER, THIS ONLY RECORDS ON DVD+R'S AND DVD+RW'S-ITS REALLY SIMPLE AND IT ALWAYS SAYS IT IN BIG EASY TO READ LETTERS ON THE BOX/CASE/WHATEVER...I read the earlier review and I havent had any problems like that yet. Although once it did freeze once and I had to unplug it once to get it to reset or whatever. If you understand that its kind of like a computer and freezes like one than its no big deal. I have only bought 1 set of DVD+R's by memorex and they have worked flawlessly. And yes you can record anything that a vcr can also. And if you still have your vcr and those Gigantic VCR tapes and you want to transfer to digital for good, you can do that with ease (If you need help dont hesitate to ask).It is a good looking gadget with pretty user friendly controls (except for that Phil guy! What the h@#$!)I record all my disposable shows (Seinfeld,JJudy,60 minutes) on my one supplied DVD+RW and I record and erase-just like a tape. And it says that you need to finalize your DVD+R's to play them on most dvd players(You cannot finalize DVD+RW's) but I tried to play the unfinalized DVD+RW in my cheap AMD DVD player and it played! I record on the lowest quality which is adequate for me and I get 8 hours of recording on one disc. This thing has 6 recording settings so you can adjust the quality accordingly-M1 for highest quality(1 Hour) and M8 (8 Hours) So far so good, and for the price you cant beat this deal if you are making the jump into digital recording.

I have never had a disc warning problem, I have had to reset it once, and most of the other various problems have never happened either.If it is discontinued, I guess this review is moot, but I want to defend the reputation of this machine.Anyways, I have recorded hundreds of shows on Imation DVD+R's, and the one supplied Memorex DVD+RW-which recently stopped playing and recording altogether...but after I recorded dozens of favorites.

While it was a huge savings at 35 USD, the old adage \"You get what you pay for\" proves itself true once again.First off, as other owners have blogged here, the install booklet is horrible. There are part names mentioned by name (eg Lag screws) that are NOT named in the Parts Listing or Diagram.Secondly, and most importantly, the pre-drilled holes DO NOT ALIGN properly with a 16\" or 24\" stud distances. What I mean is my wall has stud CENTERS that are exactly 24\" apart. Regardless, even if they were 16\" apart, the pre-drilled holes in the Cheetah mount would FORCE ME to be WAY OFF center .. close to the edge of BOTH studs. While that might work, it's terribly close to the edge and therefore UNSAFE .. especially if the screw ends up not going in perfectly straight therefore coming out of the side of the stud.This is a HUGE oversight in the hardware design. This product appears to originate from Assai Photo Supply - browse to:  [...]/Assia-Photo-SupplyI am very displeased with this purchase. I would much rather spend 100 dollars MORE, to know that my children will be SAFE while walking under / near to the mounted TV.===========**UPDATED** See my follow-up post below. In short, the install booklet includes a diagram showing where to place the lag screws for mounting to the studs. The small holes CAN NOT be correct, as they do NOT align with 16\" or 24\" spaced studs. Instead, use the oval holes, despite that they aren't perfectly aligned either.

Even though we have only used it for a few days I can tell that it's a decent product.  I've got a Garmin GPSMap 76CSX that I use.  The Tom Tom doesn't have as many features as my Garmin but is way more user friendly.I went with this model Tom Tom for her because 1) it got really good reviews 2) it has a good size screen and 3) it has text to speech so it can speak street names.  I like the unit, it does what we need and didn't cost a fortune.  Right out of the box it was easy to update the software and download the latest maps.  In comparison, Garmin maps and map updates are a PITA to download. The user manual could be more detailed but this is common with all the GPS manufacturers it seems. If you want help with your unit I suggest going to one of the Tom Tom forums where you will find all kinds of information from people willing to help. The mount was easy to install on the windshield and I think it is a nice simple and secure mount.  It also comes with a disc that will allow you to mount it to your dash instead of the windshield. It comes with the cigarette power cord for the car but no home power cord. I don't consider this a drawback as it comes with the USB cable for your computer and is powered through this when connected to your computer.Before you do anything (updates or downloads) with this unit make a back-up copy of the unit as it comes out of the box. This is easy to do as when you first plug it into your computer it installs the Tom Tom Home software which easily allows you to back-up your device. Tom Tom forum offers advice on what they recommend you do with your new unit to back it up and I think it is good advice.The map updates for the Tom Tom are considerably cheaper than those purchased for my Garmin. Overall I like the unit, my wife really likes it, and both of us would purchase one again if needed.UPDATE. I bought my wife's in DEC 09, we both liked it so much I bought the same model again for me but with lifetime map update.  I purchased mine in FEB 11 and they have dropped in price quite a bit.

There is a usb port in the front and a HDMI port and RCA connections in the back. There is also an ethernet port for wired network connection. The player is wireless (wi-fi) capable as well. It comes with a powerful remote (batteries included). As has been in other electronic items, no video/ethernet cables are included.Set-up: There is an easy setup menu for language, TV screen type, quick start (on/off) and the network. You can choose wired or wireless connection. If you want to use a wired connection, hookup the ethernet cable \"before\" turning the unit on. Otherwise, it might have some issues detecting the connection. For wireless, there is an easy \"WPS\" connection mode if your router allows it (No need to type any password during setup). Otherwise, you may choose to type the password and connect - be warned - typing lengthy passwords with special characters can be a pain using bluray player remotes.Menu: The opening menu has setup, videos, music, photos and network options. Menu options are highlighted by a light blue flashing background (It is hard to see sometimes - not very good). You can use the navigation buttons on the remote to choose any of these self-explanatory options. The network menu provides access to internet media such as netflix, you tube. Unfortunately, the internet media options on this player are very limited compared to other models. For example, there is no viera connect menu which helps you access media such as Amazon video!! If you have a network player (or itunes server) setup in your home, the player can access it and play it as well. In addition, if you setup a DLNA media server (e.g. Mezzmo) on your computer, the player can detect it and play videos from your computer as well.One option available from the main menu is \"personalization\". not sure how much I would use it, but each member of your family (upto 4?) can have the main menu personalized (name, icon, wall paper etc).Performance: I tested a couple of bluray discs and several DVD discs. It played them all flawlessly. I am not sure if the quick start made any difference - it started playing about the same speed as my other player. It displays pictures and videos from usb thumb drives very well. I ran a slideshow which ran flawlessly (Do want to note that it does not zoom low res photos; you will see them smaller in size on a high res TV). The usb port is rated 5V 500mA - not sure if that means it can support usb hard drives that have such power requirement (I dont have one to test).The player also automatically searches for firmware updates and prompts you to update if one is available. There is a lengthy menu to navigate, but update is fairly quick. You also have the option of downloading the update on a computer, burn to a CD-R and use it to update.I didnot see the freezing problems (yet?) that other reviewers reported. I did do a firmware update as the first thing after starting the player up.EDIT: It did freeze a couple of times with youtube within an hour of posting the original review (not internet freeze, but menu freeze). I guess the disc freeze might be forthcoming.Bottomline: Despite the slim network media choices on this player (does not even have Amazon video), it plays bluray discs, DVDs, home videos and DLNA media (depending on your media server's ability to encode) very well.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Plays discs well, but slim internet media options (No Amazon video!!)", "unixReviewTime": 1348617600, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2012"}

While v.1 had amazed me during my ownership, with IS, with speed, with color, with bokeh.....it does not come close to this new mk2 (v.2) version by any means.  I am glad I sold v.1 for 1750 and received 1550 in cash after all fees was deducted (2months ago).  Here is why:Mk2 PRO (vs Mk1):1) Super sharp at all focal length even wide open at f2.8 (now those 70-200 F4 IS fan boys can't complain about the lack of sharpness on the f2.8 big brother anymore).  The shorter minimum focusing distance (mfd) makes this lens even more usable indoor.2) The focusing speed feels more responsive and accurate.  It is also quieter, almost inaudible.3) IS is truly improved.  Although a tiny bit heavier, I still manage to take sharp pics with shutter as slow as 1/15 of a second handheld.  (You can put the mk1 on a tripod, and the pic you take with mk1 will always be softer than my mk2 handheld, especially at 200mm)4) Fluorite element: this is not a gimmick, and the reason it is inside all the larger L white lenses.  It really controls light better so images doesn't appear washed out or have unwanted light under extremely bright situation.CONS:Price? (Before you own the lens price can be a CONS.  Once you use it, it will be a non issue with regards to value/performance ration).  Just think about having one zoom from 70mm~200mm that gives you sharp picture wide open through out, that easily translates to 3 to 4 prime lenses (to offer the same sharpness at each focal length)...then think how much you would have to pay for those lenses and how much they would weight together, and how much time you will waste swapping lenses, while with this lens you just turn the focusing ring, shoot, and smile ^_^.I will post some pictures later on, but so far I am totally satisfied as you probably have seen from other owners.  If you can afford to spend the extra 7~800 for this zoom range you need or have always wanted, I guarantee you will not have any remorse.

Although 200mm f2L is faster and sharper, better bokeh, color saturation...it does not replace this zoom, due to fixed focal length and weight.  I really like the flexibility of this zoom, with it's ultra sharp results and excellent color.  This lens will be in my bag permanently, along with 100mm macro, and my 17-55mm (my next zoom lens will be 24-70 2.8L...so I have full coverage from 11mm~200mm all at f2.8) You will not be disappointed I promise.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing!

Man was I exited while unpacking this baby, since I had long been waiting to replace my old sub box which was to big and the shape was not any good either. Well I was a little afraid to open it up and see some damage from shipment since it came a long way from here. So  I was so happy when I opened it and saw that it was perfectly packed and then after I oppened the main box saw that this product was plastic wrapped and with a carton paper stappled to it. I almost freak with this thick sapples, but when I saw the thickness of this box, I knew it was nothing to worry, and actually it helped to have this carton paper stappled to the box whole, so that it prevents the inside from getting al dusty. Well I examined the box thourougly and it looks of superb construction. Chinese manufacturing has improved a lot! Now when I see something made in China, like this product, I now know that, that old bad repp for chinise made stuff it's long gone. This is a really well constructed box. The 3/4 thinkness mdf material looks great. There was like about 8 screws or more spread all over the sub box inside, but that does not lower a star for me. I simply search all the box inside for no loose screws left, pick them up and put them in a little plastic bag to use them later for something else like screws for attaching the SUB to the box. The interior padding on the walls and ceiling of the box was ok, nothing fancy, it did look like home made, but I am sure it will do the job of cushioning the air damp of the sub. I have not install it on my car yet cuss I am waiting for the the rest of my gear to arrive. Sub, amp, ints kits, etc. But I can't wait to try my Pioneer Premmier TS-W1207D4, dual 4 ohm voice coil, 400 watts rms paired with a Planet Audio 500 watts @ 8 ohms, Anarchy AC3000.1 D class monoblock amp. Well will see how that goes when I received the rest of my gear! I will come back and tell you guys how this box performs with that, and I will be sure to review the other stuff which I bought all here at Amazon !!!***Update***So I finally was able to install my Pioneer Premmier TS-W1207D4, dual 4 ohm voice coil, 400 watts power handling, paired with a Planet Audio 500 watts rms @ 8 ohms. It sounds great ! This is exaclty the box I needed ! At first it looked to me like a non trunk box, but this box sounds great for a sedan/trunk subwoofer aplication. It actually sounds better with the trunk closed, and it also sounds better when you are inside the car. Before I used to have basooka style box, a kind of tubular one, the long ones that are like a cylinder, and I had to open one of the rollable back seats, in order to get better bass sound. Now with this box I get a great tight bass with the back seats normally (closed). I get an evenly spread great bass all over the inside of the car ! No distortion or crappy bass what so ever ! Pefect box for a medium to big trunk !17/08/2011Just wanted to add:Still very happy so far with this subwoofer enclosure. I wanted to add that what I did to get the most good quality sound out of it, was in the installation, where I did not used the speaker wire terminals that this box come with. Instead I took them apart and actually used a direct line of 12 AMG good quality wire/cable that connected directly to the subwoofer's terminals inside the box. Then I was left with two little holes on the plastic part were the terminal leads used to go, and I sealed one of the little holes with Loctite PL Polyurethane adhesive and the other hole I made it a little bit bigger by melting it around as small enough as possible, just enough for the 12 gauge wire to pass by and connect directly to the subwoofer.Highly recomend this as a subwoofer enclosure !!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Superb Construction and exelent quality !", "unixReviewTime": 1297209600, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2011"}

Fairleigh", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I've had this TV for about 3 weeks now, and every time I turn it on I still get a big smile on my face.  We shopped HDTV's hard for several weeks.  When we started I was heavily biased toward either Samsung or LG, based mostly on reputation.  An online acquaintance talked me into at least giving a fair look at the Aquos and once I did, I was sold.  We looked at all the Samsungs and their 8000 series - at a price of several hundred dollars more - was the only one that had a picture that could compete.  On top of that, the silver trim of the 8000 wouldn't go with our decor at all.  One of the more trivial things I like about the Aquos is that the black bezel is stout enough to give the display real support and protection, while still being very unobtrusive.The native sound/speakers on this TV is better than any other 46\" HDTV we looked at.  In my opinion, native sound is just horrible on all flat screens, but relatively speaking this is the best I've heard.  More importantly I think, is the fact that the TV is at a nice full volume when set to around 15-20%, unlike many we looked at that I could hardly hear when they were at 50%.Along the same lines, I dislike how most of the current TV's require their video settings to be at max, or close to it, in order to provide their best quality.  I've fine tuned the settings on this TV using settings posted in online forums by other owners, and virtually all the settings are between 50-65% of their range.  To me that indicates sound and honest design.I am absolutely in love with this TV and would buy it again in a second.

It has consistently, reliably charged my various devices - iPhone, iPad, keyboard, earbuds and MiFi have all gotten extra boosts of power from the battery pack.  It's getting a little worn out after two years of use, so I was on the hunt for another one.  Based on reviews and my positive experience with my current charger, I bought the New Trent PowerPak Xtreme NT120R external battery pack.I have to admit, the first thing I noticed when I picked up the box was not the battery pack itself, but the packaging.  The package has a flap, which normally would swing around and be generally annoying; this package, however, used two small magnets to hold the flap in place.  Nothing to do with the battery pack, but shows that New Trent is thinking about the details and consumer when they design things, even the packaging.The first thing I noticed when I pulled the battery pack out of the box was the weight - man, this thing is heavy for an external battery.  I carry my battery pack in a backpack, so it's not a big deal for me, but there's no way I'd carry this battery around in a pocket.  It reminds me of a tractor tread, not only in its color and design, but also in the way it just seems to be sitting on the counter and saying \"I dare you to try to hurt me.\"  It looks practically indestructible!I found the power button on the side and turned the battery pack on - four small, well-hidden blue LED lights showed me four levels of power.  I was about to wash the dishes, so I carried my phone and the battery pack into the kitchen and charged the phone while I listened to a podcast.  While I was washing dishes, I accidentally splashed the battery pack with water - the battery didn't skip a beat.  The packaging claims the battery pack is waterproof, so I figured I'd test it with my full sink.  I unplugged the battery pack and dunked it in the sink - still didn't skip a beat!  Not that I'd normally toss the battery into puddles or swimming pools, but it's nice to know if I get caught in the rain with my backpack the battery pack won't die.The battery pack comes with a USB cable, but no wall charger.  Not a problem - if you don't have an extra wall charger from a phone sitting around, New Trent's got you covered with the NT90C dual charger.  The only thing I find even mildly annoying about the battery pack is the amount of force required to open the door covering the USB slots on the bottom.  It doesn't quite make me feel like I'm ripping my fingernails off when I open the door, but it is a little uncomfortable.  I understand it's got to make a tight seal, and I appreciate the lid is probably designed to not wear out over time, so I can give this a pass.All in all, I love this battery pack.  I'm prone to dropping everything, as the scuffs and cracks on my current battery pack and phone case show.  It's so nice to have at least one thing in my pack that I can drop with no fear of breaking it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This battery pack is great - tested drop proof!", "unixReviewTime": 1395532800, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2014"}

The battery is small so don't expect to charge tablets and smartphones many times.There's an iOS and Android app that allows you to access your files from your iPhone and Android-powered devices.

They are cemented together at three or four (small, about 3/4in x 1/8in) attachment points along each side. The glue appears to be some form of rubber cement - not a particularly good idea. Some reviewers have noted that this \"breaks\" - the glue is probably just failing. It can be easily repaired using a plastic epoxy (plastic weld) - although a little more attention to construction would have removed this problem (the design would be much improved by using a locking mechanism between the two plates instead of glue).The latching mechanism for the Kindle is substantial at the bottom, somewhat flimsy at the top; I suspect that the ultimate failure will be the top latch breaking - so refrain from putting the Kindle in and taking it out on a regular basis, and be gentle when latching/unlatching the upper tab!The design is open (like a book) it would have been a good idea to provide a clasp to keep it closed  when not in use (like some of the old hefty leather bound books) - it would have improved the protection afforded in case of the Kindle being dropped.The use of this case as a bookstand has marginal utility IMHO. The case does not like to be laid with the front and back covers laid flat against each other (think of a book; this kind of mistreatment results in a broken spine, and/or separation of the leaves from the covers - NOT a good idea).

First things first, the Archos has some glowing reviews, and I've got no hatred against it, other than the subpar battery life (ofcourse, they offer a replacable battery). The Zen is slightly lacking in display quality behind the Archos and Cowon, but their audio quality is superb.Which brings us to the Cowon: the main reason i bought this over the Archos was a) better battery life (though it's not replacable) b) extensive file type support and firmware upgrades (definitely good because they can always add future releases for better performance and new file types), c) it's cheaper than the archos, and d) it runs on linux.Out of the box, they give you EVERYTHING. The cables are there for plugging into your tv, to use as a usb host, and ofcourse, the main USB interface cable. They include a quality case, and a little wrist band to hold on to the player (very useful). AC adaptor also included. the headphones are bass heavy, loud, and very clear considering they're standard inserts. i'm personally buying a more expensive pair, because i ride the train to work and need some decent noise canceling. you don't need to buy a separate pair of headphones if you're using the unit in a normal, not very loud, operating environment.that brings us to the player itself. the interface is very clean, and support for all different video and audio file types is extensive. the picture quality is superb, to say the least. the playlist feature is great, and the joystick functionality is different than the archos, but still very good, especially if you're used to that kind of thing. best of all, battery life is fantastic. i get about 7 hours of video plus an additional 1-2 hours of audio in before it decides to die. this is FAR better than the archos.sound quality is also great, really depends on your file type and how well the file is encoded. i watch some good quality recordings which really come to life on this thing.recording quality is decent too. i've converted some old VHS cassettes to divx with the unit, and it does the job very well.all in all, if you are looking for a great player with a decent price tag, and one that has all the bells and whistles included, this is the unit to go with.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent performance, build, and quality", "unixReviewTime": 1174348800, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2007"}

{"reviewerID": "A3I04CBXGNEX6", "asin": "B000V7AF8E", "reviewerName": "Farthion", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I used to do photography professionally, but sold my gear over the years as film became all but obsolete.  I've recently seen pixel ranges come up to near 35mm resolution and decided to get pack into it on a semi-professional basis - mostly for sittings rather than on-the-go stuff.  I use a Pentax X-5 for my shots now, a heavier camera than my older, lighter tripod could comfortably handle.  Toward that end, and because I'm cheap, I bought the Vista Explorer.  So based on once having had many different quality tripods in the past, I start out with five stars and evaluate it.I was initially very impressed.  The Explorer is heavier weight compared to others in its price range.  It looks smart, has a nice carrying handle and, once things are tightened down, doesn't wiggle too much.  It sets up and takes down smoothly and handles uneven surfaces well.  The pan and tilt grip is large enough to be useful but small enough not to get in the way.  The leveling bubbles are a nice touch with one on the base at the top of the tripod legs and the other on the head.  For greater stability, it has a hook on the bottom to which a light weight can be attached.  The tilting mechanism is relatively smooth.  The removable mount is convenient and easy to use, and not something you usually see on a tripod in this price range.On the down-side the working parts are almost entirely plastic.  It's an ABS plastic that doesn't seem light, but it gives the tripod a slightly cheap feel to it.  The screws are steel, though, which makes up for some of the plastic cheapness provided it doesn't come apart later.  The fold-down grip on the camera screw is very small, which makes putting on the camera a bit of a challenge if you have large fingers (like I do). Another problem is that the leveling bubble in the head is to the side, and covered by the camera.  You can't see it unless you remove the camera and adjust the level that way, or put in your camera &#34;sideways&#34;.  I usually shoot based more on framing than on leveling, so it isn't that much of a consideration for me.But the biggest issue is the panning and that's where it critically fails.  While the tilting is fine, the panning quite simply sucks.  It's sticky, jerky and can not be made smooth with any lubrication I've tried from water to a petroleum jelly.  You can literally knock the tripod over from trying to pan with one finger if you don't hold on to it.  Tilting doesn't do that.  This causes gross over compensating in framing adjustments because you have to overcome the stick at the beginning of the pan, only to go so far to the other side it's literally easier to pick the thing up and turn it than it is to make fine panning adjustments.The ironic thing is that it does have a panning lock knob, which is utterly unnecessary.Whether or not the panning issue evens out as time and wear breaks it in remains to be seen, but as it is now, the panning issue is a major one if you need to do any fine side-to-side framing adjustments like panoramic shots, video or telephoto.So overall, while I was impressed with the feature set, the general &#34;cheapness&#34; of it is disappointing and the panning issue makes it a non-starter for a professional.  For each I removed one star.  Time will tell if the impression of the plastic's cheapness is offset by durability and if wear and use smooths out the panning.  If it proves durable and the panning issue eventually goes away, it will earn four stars (mostly because it wasn't 'perfect' out of the box), and I'll revisit this review and rating.For the average photographer who wants something a little better than a ten dollar tripod, this one will certainly fit the bill.  It has a good feature set at a good price.  If you just set it up and shoot and don't have to pan much, you'll be fine with it. For a professional, I wouldn't recommend this unless you need something a little more up-scale that you aren't afraid to break or lose.  For the price, the feature set makes it a viable &#34;throwaway&#34; for those riskier, outdoor or on the road shots, provided you have the patience, or lack the need, to deal with the panning issue.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "It has its pros and cons", "unixReviewTime": 1393804800, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2014"}

On the plus side, the compartments hold the individual units, extra batteries, lens covers, and just about everything I can imagine.I wish it came with an instruction book on what the best way to carry a tripod with the 'tripod' straps would be, since its internal structure is padded yet not armored to the point where I wouldn't fear a flexing or bending of the bag due to the weight of a tripod. Still, anything is better than carrying a tripod on a shoulder strap or in one hand when climbing a mountain to get a great shot overlooking the Valley Of The Sun or Sonoran Desert, and I imagine not falling over due to imbalance will pay off. I imagine that once I start obtaining additional lenses and extra doodads, the rest of the pockets will really pay off.The best part about it is the price!

I really wanted something that worked, but I thought a passive antenna wouldn't cut it. I originally hooked it up directly to my television downstairs with OK results.  I then moved it upstairs since I had a coax cable that went from the upstairs closet to my TV downstairs.  This really worked much better.  I can now catch every major channel from 15 to 69.  I'm getting some analog channels out of Mexico that are a bit fuzzy, but I don't need to watch them anyway.  However, I've been unable so far to catch channels 8 and 10, which are VHF.  These stations are actually closer to me than the UHF stations.  The antenna says it's made mainly for UHF but should be able to pick up VHF as well.  So far it doesn't.  I have a splitter joining the antenna coax to my main coax run, so I'm going to go find an extension connector to see if I can improve the signal strength.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "UHF is working, Still trying for VHF", "unixReviewTime": 1326326400, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2012"}

Note the title calls it a \"converter\".One issue I have is that many of my slides are in 126 format which is square.  A few slides can't be scanned without cutting off the top of heads.  I got around the problem with some of them by scanning sideways, which works if there isn't anything on the edges that you don't want cut off.

Slightly worse than a much older/cheaper router I was using. And don't forget, while 5Ghz is faster, the range is much shorter, so I won't diss this router's range on that front.What saves this router for me, and gets me to recommend it to everyone, is the storage port. Plug a large external drive into this router, and you can stream media from it to the whole house, without needing a dedicated computer for the job. I can't emphasize how handy that is! You can also use it for backups with a little bit of configuring.There is also a printer port, for those without a wifi printer, who have previously needed a dedicated computer for one (hopefully the same one they used for media). Personally, I have a wifi printer, so can't comment on that feature.I found the user interface fairly straight forward and user friendly, however, for those that want it, people have been able to flash DD-WRT to this router. I haven't done it, and I haven't read if you can still use the external ports on it if you do. I personally doubt you would be able to, so if you can confirm one way or the other, please leave a comment.Pros:Storage port, for streaming media and/or running backupsPrinter port, for those who need itEasy interfaceWireless on/off switch, right on the router, is pretty handyAble to flash DD-WRT (Haven't seen anything on Tomato yet)Cons:Range is not very goodI saw this warning on OpenWrt \"Security warning: unpatched http/tftp backdoor in original firmware\".

I thought at the cost of this keyboard, but let me leap ahead to my conclusion:For a Very Small keyboard which you can Always pack and use Everywhere wirelessly via Bluetooth ,this is one great keyboard. I also make the point below that your interface may be more important than the device you use this with.I have used a lot of keyboards, cussed at a lot of keyboards. Many hinder me to make a lot of errors, which I have tediously fixed. On the road with laptops, notebooks, or using a co-worker's machine, or trying an internet place in a foreign country -- I have pounded out many keystrokes on some strange keyboards. It's okay when the work gets out,  but most other keyboards really slow me down.  The worst keyboards have layouts that suddenly send you skiterring all over your work to some place you never expected to be. Mumph.At home I still use an IBM keyboard. At work we enjoy the best of the MS full-size keyboards. I love my expensive Think-Pad but for today it is too heavy and too valuable to go on the road. It is 2013. We use 64GB SD cards; we live in Tablet-Land (Nexus 7s with OTG) We are in a world of very cheap devices, very small light machines, solid state storage -- but we also want to work...So here's my first point:What if you had a very decent keyboard which you always took with you? Which you got reeally used to? So you were productive again? One of such quality it would last a very long time? That is what I found in this Motorola keyboard. The touch feed-back is very good. The pointer stick replaces a mouse quite well. The layout is very good. I never make mistakes anymore moving around material. It has Android function keys (which I  appreciate more because they stay put on this keyboard while my other smarty devices moves them around :)  This keyboard has Windows function keys (which I am used to)  It has Blue tooth. This KB  connects to all my computers. It has a Li-Po battery that seems to last about a month. The cover keeps stuff out of the keys when travelling. A $0.99 BT dongle I can plug into hotel computers that have attached printers. I enjoy working through my familiar keyboard.so I do not have to figure out  where is the foreign language \"@\" symbol...So here's my second point:The Interface is very important.You can have the coolest smart-phone, neat tablet, clever notebook or foreign computer and when you want to work -- just get stuff done -- between you, your mind, the web, your world -- then your personal interface makes a huge difference. In a world of hieroglyphics, cute ever-changing tiny icons, endlessly \"updated\" GUIs, the one Constant is my Keyboard. So I bring along my own: this keyboard.In that context, the price is fine.Is it as \"good\" as your full-sized keyboard? No, but what is better is the big one you don't have with you. This is the one you do, a very good & comfortable keyboard to work with  According to MS Word, I have written over 1,000,000 characters with this keyboard. It may well last longer than my several dropped smart-phones, broken computers, tablets or newer tools.This keyboard?  Grab one of the last few. It is a keeper for more years than I'll own any notebook or tablet.My last point:We should encourage manufacturers and Amazon shoppers to consider for road-warriors some serious \"industrial\" quality keyboards that merit a higher price by (1) reliably (2) delivering (3) productivity -- and that important intangible -- (4)  a superior experience.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Yeah price, but a superb keyboard you'll  use for years with many  devices", "unixReviewTime": 1369785600, "reviewTime": "05 29, 2013"}

The process is not super simple, but it isn't hard either.The instructions ask you to turn off the tablet, then use the supplied solution to wet your fingers and both sides of the screen protector. Then it will ask you to use the supplied piece of plastic to push excess moisture away. If you make a mistake, it isn't the end of the world. You can try as many times as you need to in order to get it perfect. There is also a tiny screen protector for the button, which I think is a funny and nice touch.After applying the screen protector and letting it dry, I noticed tiny bubbles forming under the protector. The instrutions state that this is normal and the spots will go away in a few days. That is true. The spots went away in two days and now the screen protector sits on the screen perfectly.In summary, this is an excellent product. I highly recommend it.

(Vonage, which is like Lingo costs a few more dollars than Lingo per month.) I have switched over to using Ooma, and now I pay $0 (zero) dollars per month to make unlimited local and long distance calls all over the US. If I had a cable modem, I could disconnect my regular phone line, and use Ooma exclusively. If you use DSL, which is what I have, it depends on your phone line for the connection, but you can strip down the phone line, still get your DSL through, and use it just for incoming calls, and place the rest of your incoming, or outgoing calls on the Ooma line. No more expensive local calling package, features which are all included with Ooma, or long distance charges.Ooma connects to your broadband connection right at the modem. It does not hook up to your computer. Your computer does not need to be running. It literally has nothing to do with your computer, just your modem. Your broadband modem is on all of the time, so is your Ooma telephone.When you use the Ooma phone you use it over your regular phone system, cordless, or wired telephone. When you pick up your regular phone that you now use to make a phone call, you hear a dial tone, and make a call, the same exact thing goes on with Ooma. Once you pop for the purchase price of the Ooma device, it is possible to say goodbye to your phone bill. Although it is recommended that you keep a basic regular phone line for making 911 calls for example, if in case the power goes out. If you lose electricity, you will lose your internet connection, and your Oooma phone usage.I talk to a lot of people about VOIP, which is \"Voice Over Internet Protocol\", and a lot of them don't have the foggiest notion of what I am talking about. I realize that I am in the middle of Amazon, tech savvy central, but for those who are new to VOIP, I started this review, very clear, and plainly. Now let's get excited about what this phone does.I love the fact that you are really getting 2 phone lines in one, although they operate under the same phone number. For the life of me, I can't see any reason not to classify it as a totally separate phone line. You can plug 2 different phones into it, 2 different people can pick up those phones, and make private phone calls, you can join those 2 calls together and make a conference call out of it, by simply pressing down on the 2 top buttons on the Ooma console hub, or scout, at the same time. So if I am on the Ooma phone, and another call comes in, the second phone will ring, or you can let the voice mail take it. Someone else can take the second phone call, on a separate phone. You need to buy an inexpensive Ooma scout, which is like a mini Ooma hub, with all the same features, and buttons in order to fully take advantage of all of second line features. Like using a totally separate second phone with it. The scout is like they took the bottom right corner of the Ooma control hub, and cut out the controls including the speaker out of it.Ok if I can I digress but just for a moment. I love the blue light. I have little red lights on my cordless phone console, and the Ooma sitting next to it, with the clear tab extending out the top of the phone, which glows blue is something that I get a charge out of seeing. It glows when the phone is on during any time of the day, but when I turn the lights down to watch TV, or off at the end of the night, and see the red and blue accent lights on the consoles, I get a rush out of that. Ok, sorry, back to the features.The other thing I like about Ooma is that you can send a fax with it. Lingo doesn't send faxes with there regular service. You do have to dial 99 before sending a fax, but that is a small inconvenience to being able to send faxes nationwide, without a bill, as in totally free.The sleep button is something that is worth the price of the phone alone. It may not be important to you, but if you have your Ooma hooked up to a wireless phone with multiple stations around the house like I do, and sure enough someone is calling you, and ringing the phone when you are taking a power nap, or at 7 am in the morning. With just one button, it silences all the phones in your house, and goes into voice mail mode.The other thing I like about Ooma is that unlike Lingo, which is really just a dumb terminal, you hook up to where it comes into the house, Ooma is really a professional workstation. Even though your voicemail is stored on the Ooma servers, something you can access from anywhere on the web, the call light flickers on the voice mail button to let you know you got a call. It is like having a fully functional answering machine console, even though the calls are stored by the Ooma service. Let's call this advanced technology.The biggest advantage to Ooma is the clear strong signal. I do not hear any difference between my land line and the Ooma line. With Lingo, I get very good sound quality, but it technically is weaker, so much so, that sometimes when asked to press 1, to get through the techno operators, it does not register, and I have to passively sit by and wait until it runs out of options and rings through to the operator. Not so with Ooma. Both of the services that I had that problem with in Lingo, work perfectly with Ooma.The console also has a trash can button, so with a single push, your saved message can be deleted while hearing it. (Plus Ooma stores deleted messages for 14 days for you, just in case you accidentally deleted another family members message, and want to retrieve it.) The Ooma lounge is the online web site, where you can access all of that, plus a lot more. It is Ooma central so to speak.This review is getting really long, because I am really excited about the new Ooma freedom. One last thing I want to share with you is that I tried to use this Ooma phone in conjunction with the Lingo VOIP service. Although it works, but because you are sharing the same modem to connect through, it creates a slight hum when the phone is in use. I don't know why but when I turn off the Lingo adapter, the Ooma is perfectly quiet, the hum goes away. So from my experiment, I am going to use the Ooma phone without the Lingo line.That makes the hookup something of interest. Normally you hook up your Ooma device directly into your broadband modem, then hook up your computer, or network router, into the Ooma device. So the Ooma takes precedence. I didn't do it that way. I have a network, and I want to give my internet connection the same priority as the Ooma hub, so I use an old Linksys router, and connect the modem directly to it, in one of the 4 middle positions, (not in the WAN port) so it strictly acts like a switch with no processing, and then hook the Ooma device up to one of the other 4 available connections on the router, and do the same with the network. So it goes from modem, to a splitter so to speak (switch ports on the router, or you could use a dedicated switch) then into whatever other devices I want. In this case the Ooma hub, and my network receive the same priority, and it works great. I do not realize any bandwidth speed differences using my 1.5 meg DSL connection with the Ooma device hooked up to it.I knew that the other reviews, and the Ooma description covers the features really well, so it was my intention to cover some of the other more interesting aspects of using the phone. Hope this helps. Get the Ooma hub, I understand they have a 30 day return policy. When you add up what your phone bills are costing you, it doesn't take long to recapture the purchase price, let alone that you may have free phone service for the next 3 years, 10 years, or a lifetime for that matter.

The idea is that you can connect 2 subs directly to the amp independently at Speaker A and Speaker B and the amp would manage the bridge/parallel. I couldn't make it work properly. The subs would go out of phase. Worked fine when I bridged the subs externally and hooked them up to Speaker A.The other problematic feature is the external Punch EQ remote knob. I'll need to play with it a bit more to figure out just what is suppose to do, but from the first impression, when its dialed down to 0, the subs are basically turned off. Then when I turn it up it makes weird adjustments to the subs performance.The way I have it set up now is perfect and exactly what I want out of an amp:- Minimal Gain: set to 3 right now- Infrasonic Filter set high- Disconnected Remote EQ- Punch EQ on the Amp set to 0- Crossover set high and controlled from the headunit", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Huge power in a compact box!

I can't speak to how much sound they may leak out to the area around you when in use.  For anyone looking to drown out the noise with music, the on-ear version will be somewhat disappointing.

Weflen \"Matthew Weflen\"", "helpful": [4, 6], "reviewText": "I've had a pair of Shure E2C in-ear headphones since about 2004. The cords were starting to fray, so I wanted to replace them with another noise canceling option that would be more comfortable, not to mention cleaner and less wasteful, than jamming disposable foam pieces into my ear canals every day.I also don't want to spend $300 for Bose headphones. So I decided to trust the Sony brand name and pony up the cost of these headphones instead. I've got other Sony products that I really like.On the upside, typical of Sony products, these headphones are very sleek and well-designed. A nice leatherette case is included, which holds the phones and an adapter, as well as a space for an extra battery. The battery holder does not detach from the body of the control piece, another nice touch for people who are prone to losing that sort of thing. The headphones fold up very small, and are very light. The earpieces themselves are very soft and quite comfortable, kind of feeling like \"memory foam.\" The sound quality when turned on is pretty good - a little mushy and overly bassy, but vocals and instruments can easily be made out, and there is very little hiss.Now for the bad news: they don't \"cancel\" a heck of a lot of noise. At all. Not even a little bit. I tried these headphones on a Chicago city bus, a Chicago CTA \"el\" train, and outdoors in moderately windy conditions. These headphones canceled absolutely no talking noises, very little ambient droning, and very little of the loud sorts of noises you'll hear on a subway train. When I walked from my bus to my home, the wind overwhelmed the sound easily. I was, needless to say, extremely disappointed, especially having tried out the Bose product, and having used the Shure product for several years.I think the Sony's problems are three:1. The earpieces do not surround the ear, thus passively blocking outside noise. They are simply too small.2. The active noise canceling hardware is designed only to cancel out low frequency hums, not higher frequency loud noises (which basically account for 95% of the noise you'll encounter in the world).3. In the off position, not only do they neither isolate nor cancel ambient noise, they also sound terrible - power is required to amplify the sound and give it a relatively rich tone. Turned off, these headphones just don't sound very good.In the end, they just ended up being a decent-sounding regular pair of headphones which use up batteries in order to get good sound. Pretty lame, if you ask me. I knew there would be a difference, since in-ear headphones passively block a lot more noise. But I did not expect this much of a dropoff in noise reduction, especially for the price.I guess I'll have to stick with the Shure \"earplug\" phones, and tape up the cords with electrical tape. At least until I win the lotto and can afford the Bose headphones.

On Friday, I unpacked it and immediately found a bit of problem.  The front of the box says in big letters TomTom 540S XXL.  The large screen version.  On the back of box in very small print it said:  In the box 530S (plus the various cables).Next I did the updates as suggested.  When doing this the screen said that new software was installed for the 530S.Immediately, I called TomTom to see what the problem was.  (I did get to talke with customer support quickly.)  They checked the serial number and it matched for the 540.  And said it would function as a 540.  The lady said she was 99% sure that there was a problem at TomTom's end on updating their own software names.I tried it out later in the day and it appears to work as a 540.  It does give the lane to be in...this along with the larger screen and route planning are the reasons I got the 540.  Time will tell if this in correct.All other features seem to be working correctly.This is my third TomTom.  Also have owned a Magellean and Garmin of compariably price.  I like the features on the TomTom much better.  It does better route production and it always seems to be the best route at a particular time of day.  Another feature that I like and use is being able to sit in my livingroom and plan out a exact route to use for a road trip.  I have done old route 66, the Lincoln Highway and several others.  With the route plugged in, I never had to refer to a map.  This is a big plus for several reasons...not the least of which is the co-pilot can view the scenery without having their face stuck to the map.I do have three complaints that could easily be corrected.1.  When you reach a waypoint or destination, it should tell which side of the street it is located.2.  More memory or SD slot for inputting routes or doing updates.  I am aware that there is another model of 540S (world model) that has an SD slot but costs about $50 more.3.  I was just trying to input a route that we are considering to visit all the lower 48 states in a continuous loop.  I had to break it down into 3 segments.  It would be nice if TomTom said there were limited number of waypoints that could be entered.4.  As I have said, this is the third TomTom I have owned.  The other two broke after about 18 months each.  The 910 (top of the line at time of purchase) had the hard drive go out.  The 340 had the processor fail after about 18 months.  It was just not economically sense to have them repaired.  It would really be nice is TomTom could improve their longevity.So far as Amazon goes (I bought all three from them), I have nothing but good to say about them.  The price is excellent and the shipping is great.

Unfortunately, the major problems common to older Olympus digital cameras are still existant: mediocre software, a non-rechargable battery and a tiny media card.The D-40 lens is excellent for a camera of this size and price, resulting in superior image sharpness, even at the wide angle limit where most consumer digital cameras suffer.  It's zoom range is equivalent to 35 to 98mm on a 35mm camera and the aperture is f 2.8.  The camera weighs under 7 ounces and it is tiny, easily fitting in a shirt pocket.  Standard AA batteries will work with the D-40 if the standard lithium battery dies and you can't find them locally.I'm psyched up that we'll be carrying a camera with us to more places.

I just bought a Galaxy S4 right before Christmas, and recorded tons of video and took tons of photos on Christmas Day plus a few extra days. While assembling some Ikea furniture, a plank of wood fell on top of my phone and destroyed the screen. That was sad since it was a brand new phone, but I was even more disappointed that now I couldn't get my Christmas photos/videos off of my phone.If you connect a Galaxy S4 via USB to your PC, it will not show or allow you to transfer any of the data off of it when you have a lock screen enabled, until after you enter your PIN (my photos were on the internal memory, not the micro SD card). The touchscreen was broken and I couldn't see anything on the screen, and it took me awhile to finally come up with the idea of connecting a mouse to the screen. Luckily Android supports various devices like my wireless mouse. I purchased this MicroUSB-to-USB adapter so I could connect my wireless mouse's receiver to it. But I still had the problem of not being able to see my screen or where the mouse cursor was. So I connected the mouse to my functioning replacement phone, and mapped on a piece of paper exactly the route I had to move the mouse to enter my PIN and click 'enter'. I then re-traced this route on my broken phone and after a couple tries, it worked! All my files were saved thanks to this cheap little cable.

I will be working to repair, but needed an IMMEDIATE solution - a local store was offering this one at about 2/3 the price here on Amazon as a special deal, and I grabbed it.Since it is local, I did not have the \"battery problem\" some have experienced on other Toshiba Satellites from Amazon. I was willing to take the risk knowing the local store would stand behind the sale. I tested all of the issues others have reported (including the DVD reader - no problems) it works seamlessly.It is about 2 pounds heavier than my other computer (full weight is 5.4 pounds), but that is because it is LARGER than the other one. I love the nice bright screen, and am enjoying being able to read \"stuff\" better than a smaller screen. Unlike some, I use my laptop at home most of the time, and 2 pounds isn't a big deal.My last one was an ultra - I love having this one where I can replace the battery myself and have a spare on hand for long trips. I really do love having the Superdrive, meaning I can watch a DVD, play a CD, import songs, burn CDs. You don't realize how often you want these features until you have a computer without it.It responds slightly more slowly than the Lenovo I had, but well within tolerable allowances. I notice it most on loading internet pages. But slightly means just a tiny bit. It takes about four seconds longer to start up following a restart.It has a full keyboard, with a 10-key pad on the right. The keyboard is \"flat\" without raised keys, but have a slightly raised point on the J and F keys making it easy to find your spot.The touchpad (I use a trackball because of carpal tunnel) is configured the way I prefer, with the two buttons on the bottom.I used the memory card reader to transfer some files (some by Drop Box) and it read the card rapidly and transferred the files quickly. I am happy with that.With three USB ports, I can easily keep my trackball at hand and yet charge my iPhone if I want, and still have room to pop in a flash drive. Only one of the USB ports is 3.0, and you can change the setting to make it into a 2.0 if you want to save battery time.The screen is bright, and I am very happy with it. It is NOT touchscreen - something I am happy about. A touchscreen also is an energy hog, and I seldom used mine. Glad to go back to simple.NOTE - if you haven't used Windows 8, you will have a hard time adjusting, but that isn't the computer's fault. :-) This one comes pre-installed with 8.1 which I had already wanted. It adds functionality to Windows 8, although it doesn't compensate for everything that is a problem. You do NOT need a touchscreen to run Windows 8. I have an iPad and iPhone and am very used to touch, but didn't need it on Windows 8.While I purchased it as an \"emergency\" fill in, I will likely keep it as my primary laptop ... it is that good.

What this unit does have is seemingly endless adjustable features for your audio needs.  If you want TRUE control over your music, if you want sound quality, if you want to make even your stock speakers sound infinitely better, this unit is what you need.  When Pioneer designed this unit, they cut corners in all the right places, in order to bring you a real Sound Quality unit, available at this price.  The 2 USB inputs, along with CD, 3.5mm headphone jack, AND and SD card slot make this a true unit.  CD's died out long ago, however many of us still have them, so to have it is nice, however I may have used it once in the couple months I've owned this, as I got a 32GB SD card, loaded most of my music onto it, and just leave the card in it and search through the folders.  You can run a full 3-way active crossover straight from the head unit, set your crossover points, crossover slopes, 16 band EQ, output level adjustability, oh yeah and ALL this is adjustable between the left and right channels Independently!

{"reviewerID": "AY62TN9VGKI2Z", "asin": "B0002ZUHB0", "reviewerName": "Mitchell Small", "helpful": [141, 149], "reviewText": "I'd like to split this review into different sections: The Camera, Implementation and Bundled Software.I'll begin with the negative impressions first.ImplementationOne of the driving forces behind my new digital camera purchase was that I'd outgrown my old camera's capabilities. My skills had reached the point where having a camera that saves images in a RAW format was highly desirable. When screening my choices, the C-7000 came in at a reasonable price while offering this feature.I must digress for a moment here. It seems that RAW format is not a universal standard. My present imaging software, PhotoShop CS, lists RAW formats from a variety of vendors. Apparently all are unique. While the C-7000 was not specifically mentioned, the C-8080 and C-5060 were mentioned, as were several other Olympus models. Additionally, Adobe has proposed an open standard for RAW formats, dubbed DNG for Digital Negative, and the same list of cameras appears on the list of supported formats that may be converted to the DNG format. Once converted, a DNG image may be read by any program utilizing that format.At least that's the theory. Olympus seems to have changed their specs for RAW from the other cameras in their line up as neither the DNG converter nor PhotoShop, with the latest RAW reader plug-ins, is able to read an Olympus Raw Format (*.ORF) image from the C-7000. Major disappointment! Other than ORF images, I had no trouble reading any other images.Bundled SoftwareThe inability of my software to read an ORF image lead to the installation of the included Olympus Master software. Installation is painless: insert the disk and an auto-install wizard takes over. Once installed, the software is ready to go.Personally, I felt the software was aimed at a first time camera user. The interface was so simple I found it almost insulting. I mean, come on, do you really need a wizard to help you e-mail a photo or print a picture? You also don't need the software to transfer images to your PC (see The Camera, below). I found nothing in the software, or advertised features, to warrant the expense of upgrading to the \"full version\" at a cost of almost US$20.While the software is capable, especially if you have no other image enhancement software, there are some serious shortcomings. I hate to keep harping on the RAW format, but it's a problem here too. You are free to manipulate the image, but you can't save it to another RAW format usable by any other product. You can save the image as a JPG or TIF, but there is quality loss involved. That's what the RAW format is supposed to avoid. Olympus, PLEASE sign on to the DNG standard or at least offer the ability to convert these RAW images to the same format as your other cameras that are supported by third party imaging software.The CameraNow we're getting to the good stuff! Ten minutes after unpacking the camera, I was off and taking pictures. It's that easy. The controls were different from my old D-460, yet intuitive enough there were no major problems. Even if this was your first digital camera, I estimate you could be taking your first digital photos in less than half an hour. The setup folder is easy to follow. I used the battery without charging it and got about fifteen exposures before I ran it down. Fully charged, I'd expect about a hundred exposures before recharging.Now that I had some test shots, I wanted to see them. Without reading the manual, I simply plugged the supplied USB cable into the camera and then plugged the cable to my PC via a hub. Windows 2000 showed a notice that new device was detected and in a couple of minutes I received a notice my removable drive was ready to use. No additional disks to insert for drivers, no Internet searches for drivers or anything more complicated than finding an open USB port. Windows Explorer showed the new drive and I was able to navigate to the photos, drag `n' drop to a temporary folder and I was able to view them with my graphics viewer of choice (JPG images only). I'd expect the same to be true for Windows XP or Mac users.The only customization I'd done to this point was selecting an image size of 640 x 480 to maximize the number of images stored on the supplied 32 Mb XD flash memory. During use I was impressed with the speed it wrote to the memory. On viewing the images, I was impressed with the evenness of the exposure, accuracy of focus and quality of the flash. Using a tabletop to hold the camera steady, I did some available light work with exposures of one to two seconds length. The resolution is impressive as is the contrast of the images. I don't have any objective data to back my results, but I'd match this camera against any other fixed lens digital camera on the market. Superb optics!Another major surprise was the camera body finish. The brochure describes it as Titanium. I don't know if Olympus is describing the color or the actual material, but it certainly isn't plastic! The shell has a nice solid feel in your hands and, while I wouldn't deliberately drop it, it gives the impression of ruggedness. Holding it you feel your money was well spent.ConclusionsOverall, I'm very pleased with this camera. I bought it because I wanted something compact and rugged, yet easy to use. I bought it for the quality of the camera and the picture taking ability of the camera, not the software. In time, I'm sure my problem with the ORF images will be solved and the image format in no way interferes with the camera's abilities. I would suggest two accessories to purchasers of this camera, both of which are based on common sense, not any shortcoming of the camera.1) Get an extra battery and always keep a charged spare with you.2) Buy the highest capacity XD card you can find. You'll use it!To Olympus I'd suggest offering some conversion of this new ORF format to DNG and perhaps marketing another package that is priced to include the camera and XD memory without the proprietary software. While the software may be useful to some users, it is an unneeded duplication for others.12/23/2004Adobe has solved the problem of reading the RAW format. There is a new plug-in for PhotoShop, RAW 2.4 Beta, that allows me to read the ORF this camera generates. I still stand by my 4 star rating based on the quality, or lack there of, of the bundled software. The camera by itself earns a full 5 stars, it's the total package that suffers.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great Camera, Questionable Software, New RAW Format", "unixReviewTime": 1101686400, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2004"}

There are plenty of features which cater to all manner of users, from the avid professional, to an amateur with limited knowledge of camera features and functions.

NOTE: There is no battery indicator on the camera, which is frustrating if you only have the stock battery provided by Canon.  The only battery info that the camera will provide is a red flashing battery symbol when it's about to die.  That's not much help.

It comes with a little bag for you to put your cables in because this charger can charge both your iPhone and iPad both at the same time without overheating. Now the other great thing I love about this charger is that it's smart enough to stop charging when your battery is full and it doesn't overheat like most others.  This should last you a good amount of time/days without having to recharge the device.I didn't edit my first comment because that was true of the unit I first received which was partially defective but the one hey sent as a replacement is a killer charger. This is certainly something you want to carry with you if you are a business man traveling 3 or 4 days without access to a car or outlet.

Anyway, I was looking to do a pretty big upgrade from those to something that was much better quality, but something that was also very portable, and over the ear.During my research I obviously looked at some Sennheisers', I saw a few that had good reviews and were under my budget (which was about $150 at the time). I went to a store and listened to several, including some AKGs but they were either open air headphones, too bulky, or I didn't like the sound.I eventually heard about B&W; making their first headphones which definitely caught my attention because I own home theater speakers from them. I was not so sure at first about these because they were on-ear instead of over-ear, which is what I was normally used to. I went to check them out and I was blown away by how good the sounded. On top of that, they were light, comfortable, and portable. I immediately decided to wait until I had the money for them.I finally got them today, and I literally cannot take them off my head. They are incredible. Im also very satisfied with the build quality, top notch leather and stainless steel. The highs and lows sound perfect to me, the bass is there but is not crazy overpowering.I think one thing people should know is that the ipod cable that is included might not be compatible with other devices. I tried using the cable on my Creative mp3 player and it would cause my player to shut down. I also used the ipod cable on my pc and noticed that something about the sound seemed slightly off, I switched out the cable to the regular one and the sound was alot better. I think it was the fact that the ipod cable has the volume/voice control and the tip of the cable has 3 black connections(for left, right, and controls) instead of the standard 2, so it was messing with the sound.I would recommend people to go check these out before you buy them, especially since its a lot of money, you want to make sure its what you really want sound-wise. These are built to last, and the sound amazing, just what I was looking for.EDIT: I would like to add that, to get the most out of these headphones, playing your music in lossless format is almost a must, or at least 320kbps, but anything below will probably not sound as good.UPDATE (09/16/2012):So my headphones still work very well. I just wanted to share a small incident I had with these. A couple of weeks ago I accidentally dropped my headphones from about waist height and one of the ear attachments fell off. When I tried to but it back on it would not re-attach (they attach by magnet). I realized that when they hit the ground they got demagnetized so it lost its magnetic force. I thought I had permanently damaged them but a minute or so later the magnet started working again and was able to attach it. I did realize that a very small piece from the headphone had broken off which kind of upset me (there are two small things that stick out that hold the ear pieces in place and one of them broke off). The earpiece still stays on the headphone but just wanted to share that these are not completely unbreakable as I thought. Other than that they still work great.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "After a month of research, these were the perfect choice.

DO NOT DO THIS, as it will blow the hot air generated from the CPUacross all your components, such as your hard drive and video card.  SpeedFanshowed my hard drives were cooking at 135 degrees Fahrenheit when I aimed thefan inwards.  Not good.The old dell fan had 4 wires, and this fan has 3 wires.  So I simply cut offthe plastic sockets and spliced the red, black, and white wires together,and taped up the connections.  Not the prettiest, but it works fine.  Theblue wire was left hanging, perhaps that was a temperature sensor wire to rampup the fan speed when needed.  The Zalman seems to run at constant speed, whichisn't silent, but produces a low \"air moving sound\" (even at 100% CPU load) whichis a joy compared to the loud vacuum cleaner sound of the original Delta faninstalled by Dell (Model # AFC0912DE).The fan includes a \"Silent Mode\" resistor, which made the fan run silently, butit then didn't move enough air cool adequately.  The \"Silent Mode\" resistor wasremoved and temps are now good (download SpeedFan to verify your temps beforeand after installing the fan).  Hard drives are now at 104 degrees Fahrenheit;Dell's lame motherboard doesn't support CPU temp monitoring.This fan moves 53 CFM (Cubic Feet Per Minute) in normal mode and 38 CFM in \"SilentMode\" using the included resistor in the wire.Noise levels are 20 dB in \"Silent Mode\" and 36 dB in normal mode.Also included in this \"Plus\" version are 4 silicon pins, instead of metal screws,to attach the fan to the case.  They're supposed to \"isolate\" the fan from thecase and reduce vibrations.  These seem to work OK, but make removing the fandifficult.

I use it for both storing music to listen to while I work and to save any interesting news stories to look at later at home.  One of the weakest points of any USB drive is the moving parts.  You have either the swivel kind that will eventually get floppy, the kind that retracts that can get broken and no longer come out, and the traditional caps.All these moving parts will nearly always wear out or break before the memory in the drive would expire.  A great solution is to get one of these cases and then you don't have to worry about retracting, swiveling, or losing a cap.

I'm glad to have carried this lens with me (rented).  It's heavy duty and while it does make a buzzing noise it's not loud nor could be heard especially at an event.It's relatively small, compact like the 50mm f/1.8 lens but the hood is made of metal with metal mount.  Tiny but made very well.  The AF was spot on and came out sharper and kept more photos than my 70-200 f/4L shooting outside.Yes, there's a heavy distortion but it's not a circular fisheye either and can be corrected in post to a degree (I didn't heavily correct it).  I don't have to worry about a group of people dancing while trying to focus but let the lens do its job.  Few times I just blind shot behind me and from above with my arms raised and got some pretty neat shots.  The couples and their family/friends all loved the portraits from it.  With the subject being in center, the middle area of course aren't distorted like the outer.  Again, it can be corrected but for a different style to add to the photos this lens is a great choice.I would also use this for landscapes in area you want to cover more of.

The numeric keypad is just that, not much else to say.I would have given five stars for usability if it had dedicated Home and End keys.

He shook his head like \"Are you kidding me?\" So I kept my $20 and moved on.Since then I've tested out a number of inexpensive stabilizers and makeshift rigs -- some useful, some crap. So while experimenting with some designs of my own I ordered this as an extra point-of-contact for possible a DIY rig in the future.When it arrived, I threw it on the bottom of my Canon 60D with a nifty-fifty to see how bad it actually was.Short review: I love it!Obviously it's not a Steadicam or a Red Rock shoulder rig, BUT with a little getting used to it DOES provide a very easy, low profile, highly maneuverable, inexpensive, handheld smoothing option. The grip is extremely comfortable and the pistol feel is much like an old Bolex.For WALKING SHOTS, I recommend only using a wide lens (50mm or wider) that's stopped down for deep focus.For STATIC SHOTS where a little organic motion is acceptable, I feel like ANY DSLR with pretty much ANY LENS would be decent on this little guy. There's nothing above to interfere with your racking reach and with a little grace the act of racking itself will give you another stabilizing point of contact.I also advise using a soft, stretchy neckstrap on the camera in the extended position to get another point-of-contact for anchoring & smoothing movement.So buy this & keep it in your kit bag. Play around with it and you might just have the touch to get smooth handheld shots with cool minimalism.***And if you can ride a skateboard, particularly a longboard with big soft wheels, this is remarkably easy to handhold for smooth dolly-ish shots.

Looking at the screen now I cant even tell there is a cover on it except for 1 little cloudy spot still left to go away which I'm certain will.Tips on installing:1. Watch the video!!!!! It was very helpful and showed you exactly how to install it.2. If you want to reduce the chance of dust install it in the bathroom with a hot shower running. The steam will help pull the dust out of the air.3. While they say only spray both sides on the cover and your fingers I also put a small amount of solution on the screen itself. This allowed me to move it around easier and place it exactly how I wanted.4. Once you have it positioned work your way from the middle out lightly at first to tack it down. Once it is tacked down in at least one spot start to push the solution out.5. Dont rush! Take your time and it will turn out perfect!6. Listen to them and let it sit! It will look cloudy at first which makes the screen look very pixelated but once the solution dries it will clear up. These people complaining about the cloudiness do not know how to read instructions.Not sure how much it will matter to some but the screen protector does have a rubbery type feel to it.

If you're looking for a 50mm prime, you know there are 3 choices from Canon. The almighty 50/1.2, 50/1.4, or this 50/1.8. The 1.8 is a natural buy especially for beginners b/c it's so affordable. Prices usually fluctuate from $90-120.I'm using a T3i/600D. My views of this lens:- For what I use it for, which is indoor shooting with available light, wide open at 1.8 is not terribly sharp. But the shutter speed gain is great, plus I don't have to boost ISO as much.- It's EXTREMELY cheaply made. Really, this thing is all plastic, feels very hollow and feels like a toy. It's also a bit big compared to some other 50 out there (i.e., Minolta's excellent 50/1.7). I would not be surprised if you found lots of dust and debris inside after awhile.- AF is very slow and noisy. Sometimes it will hunt for 5 seconds before finally locking or sometimes it will not lock at all.  At a recent housewarming party, I had to use it in manual b/c the AF just simply refused to lock in the majority of the shots. This is very annoying.But what do you expect for $100, right?  So as long as you can keep the expectations vs pricepoint reality check in line, I think you'll get great use out of this lens.  For how I use this lens, I find the focal length too long for indoors where I'm taking photos of people. I find myself hitting the walls after having backed up so much.

So my review should be rated at a 4.5 stars.*** BIGGEST REASON I PURCHASED THIS? PLAYS my AMAZON CLOUD COLLECTION SUPER DUPER! (I'm loving Amazon Cloud, take that iTunes!)***#1) Great price for a good solid Bluetooth speaker.#2) Good sound quality.  Projects sound & carries a signal through 1, 2 or 3 rooms with no issues (depending how loud I blast it and walls etc).  Sound quality not quite as good as my iPod \"BOSE\" SOUND DOCK system, but for jamming whist surfing the net or cleaning the house or just listening to good music, it is great!  Better than cheaper or smaller speakers I've tried.#3) SIMPLE.  Plug in, turn on, then set your Bluetooth enabled device to find and pair it up with.~ It reads as a \"Bluetooth Headset\" named \"GG-BLUE-SYNC\" on my Bluetooth devices that locate it~ virtual plug/play on these devices, all setup is from the device you are connecting to the speaker, there is NOTHING to do on the speaker. It just works!~ I've tested this out on my android smartphone (Samsung EPIC 4G) and my Sony VAIO L series touch screen PC, my kids phones & mP3 players with no problems connecting or transmitting via earphone jack or Bluetooth wireless.~ Its Bluetooth EASILY pairs with A2DP equipped audio devices#4) BASS projects VERY well (good speaker with a good bass level to go along with the standard sound projection).#5) Lighted indicators on front of speaker to tell if it is connected (\"-\" & \"+\" volume buttons blink when not paired w/a device, shines solid blue when actively paired)#6) Green light to indicate unit is on.#7) IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A BLUETOOTH DEVICE, IT IS STILL GOOD! As it connects with ANY mP3 player, phone, PDA or whatever that has an earphone jack connected via the back of the machine (no wire included for this).  Good sound quality there as well.#8) ON/OFF switch on back of device.#9) PORTABLE! Works where ever there is an electrical plug/outlet!#10) For the size, fairly light, but not so much it feels cheap.  Feels solid but doesn't weigh a ton.  Can carry it upstairs if I need to easily.#11) NO skipping, delay or hesitancy, just great playback via a device.  NOW.. if the DEVICE has issues, it will project that, but it is NOT the fault of these speakers!)#12 Compact, good big sound without a big price tag, takes up little space on a shelf, counter or dresser.#13) Plays whatever is being projected by the device, no risk of incompatible formats. Only limited by the device it is connected to.#14) NOT proprietary! It plays any/all makes, models & formats of devices and sound.  Again, take that certain iPhone & iPod products)#15) Found I can control the volume to a point on the speakers AND from the device itself.  Volume controls on a connected device can regulate to a degree remotely if connected via Bluetooth or earphone jack.  SO.. for the loudest sound, set the devices volume to HIGH, and the speakers to high... projects music well with good sound.CONS:~ BIGGEST CON: ....No Remote to adjust speaker volume, have to manually adjust front speaker buttons or the connected device, if I get a phone call or something that I have to turn it down quickly.  A separate remote for power/volume control would be nice.~ NOW Compared to my BOSE SOUND DOCK system, it is not as virtual 3D or super surround sound (*but comes VERY VERY close*) and didn't have to pay the $600 price tag for it.~ Wish it had a handle for easy carrying, but I just wrap it up in one arm if I need to move it, no big deal, but would have been nice.~ No instructions included in box, but you do NOT need any instructions! (some people may find this a negative, but I didn't once I turned it on, it was so easy) Since all the pairing and connecting comes via the projected device, the speaker is just a speaker.  Turn it on, locate it on your device and GO!~ Wish it had a capability to add another speaker to its connection to get better surround sound action if I wanted it in a big room.RECOMMENDED FOR: College students, kids, Moms, Dads, garages, homes, offices, where ever and whoever wants a great wireless device, or mP3 speaker.  I'm VERY satisfied, and hope this review helps.  I searched and searched for reviews for this device, and none were on the internet or Amazon yet, it was too new.  If you have questions, ask, as it looks as if I was the first one to take the plunge, and glad I did!!!!! :-)PS: for anyone that would post a con or bad review of this due to it doesn't have a battery option, this is NOT the type of speaker that could use batteries, it is a good piece of electronics, and not a cheap little thing that takes batteries.

{"reviewerID": "A2NQS1O2PL5RAV", "asin": "B00HRQB28Y", "reviewerName": "SunscreenAl \"A. Rosenbach\"", "helpful": [24, 25], "reviewText": "This review is for brand new beginners. Disclaimer--I've never edited or captured video without this program, so I can't compare it to others. I bought Vegas Movie Studio because a friend told me that it was easy to learn and doesn't freeze up.I use the program to put together family video clips. At best, these might include a title text and a fade out at the end--I am a novice and proud of it! Occasionally, I'll add a few photos and some music but that's about it. I've used the older version \"11\" for a few years but recently upgraded to the newer version \"13\". My goal with this review is to let other beginners know that even technically challenged people like myself can use this program.For first time beginners, the instructions in writing are difficult to absorb. There is a webinar online but it's hard to find. Just go to sonycreativesoftware DOT com (I spelled this incorrectly on purpose because Amazon doesn't like listing websites in user reviews). On the bottom right of that website page, there is an item you can select called \"training and tutorials\". Once you select it, you will be brought to a new page where there is a tab called video. Select the \"movie studio\" option and a new page pops up with a bunch of links. Select \"An Introduction to Movie Studio 13 Platinum\". You can stream it but there is also an option to the right for downloading it to your hard drive. This is a 42 minute webinar that explains how to make the basic movies I described above. Another great way of learning the program is to use the \"Show Me How\" tutorials. When you start Movie Studio, a welcome screen has an option called \"Show me how\". This functions like a remote tutor sharing your computer. It instructs you step by step in how to use the program. Warning--you'll need a short video clip available somewhere on your computer for \"Show me how\" to function.So how hard is it to learn? If you watch the video tutorials and play around with some of your video clips, you're out about 90 minutes. But that's all you need to use the program the way most people will probably use it--to make cool vacation or family event videos that are five or ten minutes long. Most of the clips I take from my camcorder are less than two minutes in duration. Editing them together makes them much more watchable. In addition, you can toss the bad clips and edit out mistakes, such as when I forget to turn off the camera and end up with a two minute birthday party clip--in which the last minute shows video of my feet!!!Nothing has been buggy with the old or new versions of this program and my computer has not frozen or crashed. I'd bet that some people would like to know if this upgrade was worth the money. Sorry, I'm not good enough with video to provide the answer to that question.I tend to use high def video which comes out of my camcorder at 1080p. A nine minute clip is about a gigabyte if you choose \"AVCHD\" as the file type when rendering the 9 minute movie--it take the program about 20 minutes to render a movie of this length on my 2010 Windows 7 computer.Now for advice NOT related to the program itself: I no longer use the program to make DVD's. Instead, I play the finished movies on my TV using a WD TV Media player, which has a USB input where I attach a hard drive. I store the rendered movies on this hard drive, which gets plugged into the WD TV Media player for direct viewing on the TV. So goodbye to DVD's, which don't play with anywhere near the clarity of these files. Instead of a pile of DVD's, I have at least a few hundred family videos on a single hard drive.  I try to limit the final clips to not much more than a gigabyte so that the WD TV Media player attached to my TV doesn't get overwhelmed. To accomplish my self-imposed one gigabyte rule, I limit the length of my \"movies\" to around nine minutes.After viewing these videos using the WD TV Media player,  I feel safe in predicting that most of us will not be making family DVD's in five years. In terms of ease, playing movies through the WD reminds me of the comparison between a CD player and an iPod. A single iPod holds thousands of albums, which is much more convenient than using piles of CD's. Similarly, the hard drive//WD combination holds hundreds of videos. And unlike the iPod, there is no file compression. When viewed through the WD player, the 1080p videos look ridiculously clear. I think they even look better than blu ray. Plus, like an iPod, using the hard drive through that WD player allows for clicking on any of hundreds of movies instantly.This Vegas program is so good, I've decided to use Sony cameras to take video because the file interchange is seamless. I don't know if other camcorders use the same file types, but it wouldn't be worth the time for me to find out.  A good camcorder that would have cost a thousand dollars back in the day now costs around 400 bucks. The camcorders work better than cameras for video, because most cameras skip if you move the camera from right to left or vice versa while filming. In other words, I can use the movie function on cameras to film someone blowing out birthday candles but these cameras skip when trying to film your kids' soccer games because of the side to side movement of the cameras themselves. This is my novice experience speaking, but it has happened to me with several cameras and phones but never with the camcorders.I can't answer technical questions, but this spaz was able to learn the program pretty easily and wanted to give you the two year experience report. Maybe this review can save you precious hours trying to learn a more difficult program. I discovered this program, the Sony camcorders and the WD thing by sheer luck. Since I've been on the other end of trying to learn something and wasting hours and dollars, I chose to post this review to spare others the same fate. Finally, I should also add that video clips from the iPhone work fine, although they are not as clear as with the camcorder. Good luck!!Edit Update: 6/20/14: Movie Studio 13 only produces final videos at 1080p using the XAVC format but this format makes huge files. Four gigs for a 10 minute clip is too much. The old AVCHD clips were less than half the size. I contacted Sony customer support about this and they wrote me back!! They solved my problem, telling me that I can indeed make the smaller AVCHD clips that are 1080p at 59.94 frames per second. BTW, 60 frames per second is actually 59.94 frames per second. It's the industry standard.Here's how Sony instructed me to make smaller AVCHD clips as opposed to the XAVC gigabyte chomping clips: Select \"Make Movie\". Click on \"Save it to My Hard Drive\". Click on \"Advanced Options\". Make sure the filter triangle above the list to the right says \"Filters Off\". Select \"MainConcept AVC/AAC\" from the list on the left. Select \"Internet HD 1080p\" from the list on the right. Make sure these last two selections are highlighted in Blue. Click \"Customize Template\". This opens the \"Custom Settings\" dialogue box. Where it says \"Frame Rate\", type in 59.94. Where it says Maximum bps, choose 28 million. Also, choose 28 million for the Average bps. Click on the \"Audio\" tab on the bottom of this dialogue box. Choose Bit rate of 256K. Click OK. This closes the dialogue box. At the top of the list on the right, select \"Internet 1080P(*). Make sure it turns blue. You are done!You might ask why you should do all of this-- the reason for me is that most cameras shooting in 1080P are using similar settings--I want to get the maximum video and sound compared to the files generated by the camera. This can be done with the XAVC files but they are way too huge. By taking all of the steps above, you can render a movie (Make Movie) in a format that is still 1080p and 59.94 fps, but is way smaller in size, about a gigabyte for 7 minutes. I might be a novice with video effects, but I think I've figured out the best file types for archiving and playing after reading a bunch of material on this subject. If you are a video expert, please post any critical commentary to get me to change my conclusions.Addendum--6-22-14:  I just got a new windows computer and I'm writing to tell you that video from iPhones won't work. That is, unless you install quicktime. This requires looking up quicktime on gooogle and downloading it.  For some reason, installing quicktime fixes the problem of iPhone videos not working, even if you never open the quicktime program. My guess is that installing quicktime brings in codecs to your windows computer that aren't factory installed.

It is perfect for city living photographers/filmmakers. I generally use this camera bag for broll video shoots, and it has been great. It looks like a normal backpack so generally I feel more comfortable walking with it down the street. Cameras are an easy steal.. It also has two velcro straps on the zipper, which makes it harder for someone to unzip your bag without you noticing on a crowded train/bus.The theft part aside, this bag also has a great deal of space. I cary several lenses, flash, extra batteries, cards etc, and I generally use the side straps (tripod straps) for my monopod, which fits perfectly. It's also much more comfortable when carrying for a long period of time. No more sore shoulders at the end of the day. Having the quick access top is great for run and gun photo/video. The camera slides in nicely and all the padding inside feels very thick. I have no concern about my camera being damaged by a minor bump somewhere, and they are adjustable enough to keep accessories from bouncing all over. The camera, sitting in its cradle is nearly immobilized, which is great compared to my old bags, which I was always concerned about the camera shifting in the bag. Plus the accessories you put in there all sit under the camera so you never need to worry about something bouncing around and scratching up your camera, unless you hold the bag upside down... Lastly, when I was researching this bag, I read a few reviews that mentioned the rubber bottom of the bag making it hard to access the very bottom of the bag. I agree that the bag does not open completely so it's certainly in the way, but I have not found it to be difficult to access anything. I do generally have larger lenses on the bottom so they sit high enough to get access easily despite it. I suppose it depends on your layout. I like having the rubber bottom in the event something spills or you need to briefly sit the bag on a slightly wet floor. One last thing to mention is the great little computer section. It's great to be able to fit my macbook pro into the back and take it with on the occasional shoot. I've also used it to hold/organize release forms when on shoots as it nicely holds paper/folders/13inch laptops without any problem. I sometimes am concerned about the weight of the bag squashing my laptop in the middle, since it's held between me and the bag, but it is padded, and I haven't had any issues yet...Long story short, I am extremely happy with this bag. I will absolutely buy again when it wears out, but I've used this almost daily for 4 months now, and it still looks like new, so I am not worried about it wearing out anytime soon, not to mention I bought it used, and it was sent looking like new...

The button functionality is horrible and ends up meaning many times buttons are pressed by accident.  The main issue is the horrible sound.  Maybe mine is defective, but above a whisper volume it distorts so badly that I can barely hear anything at all.  What a huge disappointment.The rundown:Just tried a bunch of these:HMDX jam bluetooth - third place - sounds awesome, very loud and great bass and does not distort. However a constant buzzing/fuzzy noise made this a no go. reasonable price at 35Satechi bluetooth audio cube - not loud at all, tinny sound, very little bass, sounds muffled. expected more from the large size of the unit compared to others and the positive reviews. overpriced at 50Kinivo wired - not very loud but otherwise great sound. great bass, clear highs.  distorts a little at max volume. great value at 20Sharkk bluetooth - second place - a best buy at 28 bucks for sure sounds great, good bass and highs, not quite as loud as the jbl or hdmx.  Comparable volume to most of the others though.JBL micro bluetooth - my favorite - first place. great volume, clear highs and good bass. Very user friendly and uses a manual volume dial so each time you turn it on it is at the previous volume. most reset to 50% every time you turn them off and back on. Bluetooth connectivity through walls is not quite as strong as others, the only con. Also can be used as a bluetooth adaptor/dongle which usually costs as much as this speaker alone. The 3.5mm out can plug into any home theater system.  Nice spot to hang it up on a nail, making the sound project farther and louder. pricey at 60 but worth it.August bluetooth - good quality and bass, however distorts at fairly low volumes making it a no goSatechi BT wireless portable speaker - worst of all, distorts at the slightest bit of bass or volume. Instant no go and a rip off at 40 bucks. can also be used as a bluetooth dongle like the jbl though. stay away from satechi.Xmini - bluetooth drops easily. by far the lightest and smallest and has good sound for it's size but little bass and not too loud. pricey at 40 for what you get.Alpatronix bluetooth - sounds great, but distorts quickly with any bass heavy music.  Also \"walks\" across the table with bass heavy songs unlike the others due to it's weight/bass ratio.  Loud, like the jbl and hdmx.

Since the phone plug is 90 degrees to the cable (which is a plus to me) I'm not positive the plug was seated correctly to begin with.  It's a snug fit against the case. Anyway, the controls now work as expected, and the mic works for phone calls.  The red insulation is not the same material as the actual beats cable, so for those that have beats 'phones, if you want that, you might want to keep looking.

With my netbook just sitting idle I felt it got too warm, much less with it accomplishing a task. And with an HD vid playing it got straight out hot. Viewing HD broadcast television and I am not exaggerating when I say the bottom was hot to the touch in places and the heat would rise through the keyboard!

It just blew hot air all over.But this MS cooling base? I was cynical...but it works. That's all I can say. My Dell Mini fits almost perfectly (it fits well) and I don't know how they did it or what engineering tricks they used, but I ran the Mini on full HD broadcast television for an hour. It used to take just minutes to heat up, as the two components required to run the television in HD conspired to melt my poor netbook from the inside out.  But I checked the Mini after watching HD news for 60 mins, and it was not hot! Not even close. In fact, it was barely warm. I don't know if it's a combination of the cooling base AND the design of the Mini's vent system, but as said I tried a few other solutions with no results. This gave me results which far surpassed my expectations. I expected a drop in temps that wouldn't be felt, but rather just something to help keep 'em lower for the sake of component life.

I noticed this happened when I turned off the player from the pause state, because stop obviously stops the disc and I didn't want to leave it running when I left the house. However, another movie I had decided to just eject from the pause state, and after watching a few other discs, the ejected disc that was in a pause state started back up from that spot when I put the disc back in. I don't know if every disc will do this, but so far it's resumed playback this way.The other thing is, if you are a quiet person and have a quiet room or bedroom, you may notice some sounds from the player. Just a faint high-pitch hum during playback or pause, and you can pretty much always clearly hear the laser moving when you skip, pause, etc. Nothing too dramatic, but enough to drive you nuts once you focus in on it.

If you want the larger screen, which I prefer, stick with this one. I've used a few different GPS systems and this is my favorite, by far. Out of the Garmin, Magellan, and Tom Tom, it just performed the best. When starting up the unit, you can choose from male or female voices and language preference and there are actually many to choose from. You can also change the color and lay out of your map, etc. This system actually has a feature where the unit gets louder as you accelerate, to compensate for the noise the car is making. Miles and time left to arrive at destination are displayed in the lower middle of screen along with the current time and estimated arrival time. It displays the speed limit and your actual speed in the lower right corner, which turns red if you are going 5 miles or more over the limit. The limit changes almost instantly when you see a speed limit sign. I was really amazed by the accuracy of that. Keep in mind that this is only on interstates, highways, and main roads. It actually didn't display the speed limit at all on other roads. It displays the miles until your next turn in the lower left portion of the screen. With this large screen, they can display so many things right there on the screen along with the map. It's just so difficult to flip back and forth when you aren't familiar with the roads you're on anyway, so it's nice not to have to with this system. A Major plus is that the keyboard is layed out like an actual computer keyboard, the Magellan and Garmin we've tried were not. They were layed out in alphabetical order, which was aggervating, as we were fumbling through the letters every time we tried to use it. This unit also shows you which lane you need to be in when exiting the interstate, etc. There are green arrows and it is so very clear which lane you should be in. I am female and sometimes have real trouble understanding directions. So this thing is never leaving my dash board. Even my husband was impressed by this one. I will be adding photos of the different displays shortly, so please check them if you are interested in viewing some of the things I've discussed. I have 1 small complaint about this system. My problem with this GPS is the problem that everyone is stating about not taking any of the updates offered to me. I would hate to ruin my system, so I'm not doing any updates, but I would hope that they would correct such a widely experienced problem. I hope I never get mine wiped out that way. This isn't a huge issue for me and I would have chosen this one if I would have known in advance. I'm really enjoying it so far and am completely impressed with the Tom Tom brand.Note: There is a place in the settings where you can change your preference to make the gps system power off when you turn off your ignition.

After I tossed out the one that failed on me (I was just barely outside the return window), I bought another.  That one has been working just fine for over 6 months.  Based on this, I feel comfortable rating this as a 4.  Based purely on functionality/size/ease of use/price it probably tends toward a 5... but questionable quality/reliability (i.e. you might get a lemon like I did the first time), holds it back to a 4.EDIT August 2010:I have bumped my review score from a 5 down to a 2 for this item.  A couple of weeks ago, i.e. after just a month or so of use, I started having intermittent audio drop-outs... and then sparklies... and then complete loss of signal.  Even after dialing from 1080i down to 720p and then 480p, no signal.  After some troubleshooting, I bypassed this switch (keeping the rest of the LONG signal chain in place), and was able to get signal to my TV again -- implicating this switch as the culprit.I am confused as to why it died a slow/gradual death, rather than a sudden one.  There was a period of a few days where the switch was \"usable,\" just with audio drop-outs and video sparklies before it finally gave up for good.  Going to see if I can return this and get it replaced, or if I just have to take it as a loss (if so... at least it was cheap).ORIGINAL REVIEW JULY 2010:I bought this as part of the signal chain feeding HD sources in my basement to a new plasma TV installed upstairs over my fireplace (see my HDMI extenders review for more details).  I selected it mainly because:1. It has 3 ins to 1 out, which is what I required for my system.2. It has IR control capability, with discrete commands for each input already present in the Harmony Remote database.3. Reviews stated it did not require an external power supply (in spite of the 5VDC in present on it).4. VERY reasonable price, and Prime-eligibleI now have it installed and it is meeting/exceeding all my expectations.  I had it passing 1080p with no problems; I eventually scaled back to 1080i due to the characteristics of my overall signal chain (again, I'll refer you to my HDMI extenders review for more detail... but in summary, it involves 27' of HDMI cable, a HDMI-to-Cat5e extender system, and ~80' of Cat5e cable) and it has been performing great.  It truly does not need AC adapter; it's drawing whatever power it needs over HDMI.  No A/V glitches or hiccups, no signal degradation, very quick switching between inputs, and it never misses an IR command (since I have an emitter bug stuck right to the IR receiver!).

I've put the speaker through a good variety of tests in different rooms while I worked on my never-ending DIY list, and the speaker sounded great in all circumstances with a good access distance for the Bluetooth signal and convenience of the access controls on the speaker itself.I haven't used the microphone feature yet, so I can't comment on that feature, but it's nice to have if I ever have a need for it.

Others may have very different reactions (apparently more positive ones), which will be affected by source material (vocals vs. instrumentals, guitar vs. piano, combo vs. symphony orchestra).I have yet to find a &#34;mini&#34; speaker that delivers the audio my ears require for listening to jazz and classical music.  (I'm so fastidious, I'll disqualify certain recordings from consideration on the basis of a recording engineer whose representation of the piano is always a distorted version of a &#34;real&#34; piano.I want &#34;real,&#34; full sounds, with &#34;true&#34; bass (not the artificially &#34;enhanced&#34; bass frequencies of the middle register.  I know there are speakers out their capable of passing my &#34;test&#34; (I begin with the bass of Paul Chambers on &#34;So What&#34; from Miles Davis' &#34;Kind of Blue&#34; and proceed from there to solo piano and then complete orchestra (from Bach to Bartok).  And I'm looking for a &#34;traveling&#34; unit that will slide as smoothly into my shoulder bag as an 11&#34; Mac Air (don't use a cover for maximum utiltiy and lightness).I'm a huge JBL / Harman-Kardon fan, and I had high hopes that this product would be a notable exception to all of the other frequency-challenger, underpowered &#34;mini&#34; speakers that I had tried (look for a few soon on Amazon).  Instead, the JBL Micro was too weak to satisfy even my wife (whose musical tastes are more broad than mine).I don't want to carry a &#34;box-shaped&#34; unit on trips much less up and down the stairs.  But I found one small unit that slipped into my bag and delivered enough sound to fill the house: the Motorola EQ7 (made by JBL).  It has not one but 4 transducers along with a heavy magnet and Blu Tooth, and its flat, &#34;omlet&#34; shape makes it fairly easy to slip into a should bag along with a laptop.  Unfortunately, the speaker has been discontinued now for 2-3 years, so an interested party needs to search for good used or refurbished units.My only caveats about the EQ7 (don't even give a 2nd look at the EQ5, which I also happen to have) is that stacking 4 AA batteries into it for portable use requires some practice and patience.  Also, the BluTooth can be a bit reluctant to &#34;pair,&#34; especially with equipment made after 2010.  Finally, after a couple of hourss, I definitely begin to feel its weight[---which must be twice as heavy as my computer.Consequently, I was quick to jump on to the comparable speaker not only manufactured by, but sold exclusively as, JBL itself.  It's the JBL On Tour iBT Bluetooth speaker which, like the EQ7, has a total of 4 transducers (2&#34; speakers) but is noticeably lighter and thinner ithan the EQ7.  The bass frequencies of the On Tour iBT are not as strong and clear as those of the EQ7, but the sound of a piano is as &#34;open,&#34; spacious and transparent, as the EQ7.  Although the user has to deal with the same &#34;battery problem&#34; and an extra button, the On Tour has become such a congenial &#34;travel partner&#34; that, when I saw that it too was being discontinued, I immediately purchased two more.  JBL would replace it with a subsequent speaker called &#34;The Flip,&#34; which I immediately had to return after hearing its distorted (to this pianist's ears) reproduction of the sound of a piano.  It's a great, dynamic company, and it can be hard to keep up with their constantly changing products (though their Harman Kardon Soundsticks have changed little since their first appearance 15 years ago (thankfully!). Regardless, the JBL name has always signified &#34;high quality&#34;--at least since I bought my first speaker from them in the early '70s (a bookshelf speaker with a 14&#34; woofer that I continue to use).Again, the above is merely one person's experience and opinion. For some reason, people tend to be especially passionate about their preferred speaker-even at extremely low price levels of under a hundred. I respect their opinions.  I've read glowing reviews of products that subsequently disappointed me.  But I never blamed the reviewer--unless it later became apparent that I had been misled by a paid hack's &#34;promo&#34; piece for the company's product.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Weak and inadequate to my ears", "unixReviewTime": 1371859200, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2013"}
{"reviewerID": "A3W4NLU1LAA153", "asin": "B002EPF6YO", "reviewerName": "Chris Longhurst", "helpful": [14, 15], "reviewText": "First the good : The audio is pretty good for an all-in-one unit like this. The fake surround effect doesn't get all wide and echo-y either - it's a feature you'd probably use. It certainly won't fool you into believing you have surround sound but it does enhance the audio reasonably well. For $99 you can't fault it. It's quite a sizable unit too - bigger than it looks in the photos. The 'feet' can be repositioned to become wall mounts too, but there's no wall-mounting hardware included. It's quite stylish. Others don't like the 'Vizio' emblem but it's a little satin-brushed metal panel that looks quite nice. If you don't like it, cover it up.The problem is that this unit is very clearly built down to a price, and like most Vizio products, the shortcomings are obvious within a few minutes of using it.So on to the problems:The IR receiver sits behind a textured grill on the front panel. The support frame for the grill is a plastic lattice that shadows the IR receiver on all sides so it sits in a recessed 'hole' if you like. It is extremely sensitive to the position of the remote like this. The only solution is to run the soundbar with the grill off (which is ugly) or to use some wire snips to snip away a couple of the pieces of plastic frame so the receiver can \"see\" more freely.There's no power light so you don't know if the unit is on or off. This is especially poor when you're turning the device off - without any indication, and coupled to the remote problems listed above, you'll end up leaving the soundbar on without realising it 9 times out of 10.There's no single-button input entry on the remote (or the unit). You have to hit the 'input' button twice to get it to the optical input for example. This alone wouldn't be so bad but it makes the soundbar incompatible with most universal remotes. Logitech Harmony remotes can almost handle it - you manually tweak them to hit the input cycle code twice. Problem then is if you switch activities, it cycles the input twice again and takes you to analog 2. Do it again and you end up at analog 1 etc). Logitech think there's a single input source IR code but the soundbar doesn't understand it.This is all compounded when you have a power outage. If you remove the power supply, the soundbar loses all its settings - which input you were on, the volume level and the settings for the sound enhancements. You have to set them all up again.Ok - not a problem if you have a reasonable electrical supply which most of us do. But if you're energy-conscious and have a current-sensing 'green' power bar that cuts off all the power outputs when it senses the TV turning off, the VSB200 is useless.It doesn't support compressed S/PDIF which makes it incompatible with a lot of Samsung, Sony, Sharp and Philips televisions. You'll have to resort to the analog audio out (if you have one). The only indication you'll get that this is the case is one of the 10 white LEDs flashing. The documentation that comes with the unit does explain this but it would have been nice to have separate LEDs for the input selection, volume and error codes instead of having them all glommed into a single multipurpose display that needs a manual to understand.It doesn't have an HDMI input. This was one of the biggest factors for me. For a set of TV speakers, the optical in is great but an HDMI input is almost a must-have.Ultimately I returned mine. I just couldn't get it to work properly. With it constantly losing its settings, the sketchiness of the IR receiver on the remote and all the other little problems, they all added up to \"unusable\" for me.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Built down to a price - too many little problems that add up", "unixReviewTime": 1300060800, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2011"}

Great laptop, reliable, and i have had minimal compatibility issues, even though I am the sole Mac among hundreds of Windows PCs.

The biggest issue I have had with my Mac is that it does not seem to do well speed-wise when multiple applications are open.  Sometimes I get the spinning beach ball for one or two minutes at a time when I try to access Finder or open a file.  The cooling fan really cranks up too.  All of this usually happens when I have more than three applications (such as Word, Excel, and Mail) open at a time.  I have 4 GB memory, so I don't think that is the issue.  Maybe Mac OS X is just not good at parsing out CPU power to several applications at once?  The overall bigger issue is Apple's wireless networking.  My MBP drops Wi-Fi an awful lot compared to the Dells in the office.  Same issue at home where I have it paired with a Time Capsule.  I often times have to switch to the main AT&T wireless router rather than the Time Capsule to get any speed and a consistent connection.

The screen is 7 inches wide and seems a bit smaller than other 7 inch tablets, however it is TRUE to the its size. It comes preloaded with Jelly bean 4.1.1 and Google Play (USA) version which I have had no issue when it comes to syncing to my Google account and downloading apps, free and paid. As for the apps they all seem to download and work, except need for speed shift, however that could be something I've done when it tells me to update the game, but all other games and apps so far have downloaded and work. It comes with Google voice however I prefer Alice (AVIC) which works seamlessly on this tablet. Standard feel is good well built not very heavy compared to the Nexus 7. The screen resolution is not as crisp and pixel free as the Nexus 7 however it's pretty close and again over 100 dollars cheaper and the HDMI works well when connected to my TV's to watch Netflix's. The Wi-Fi seems to have good range as I can connect outside my house compared to my Galaxy S3 phone it has a little weaker signal but not much. I do not have a 3G dongle so I cannot comment on that but I assume like all of those it's carrier based that will make a difference.There are NO standard USB ports on this only 1 Micro USB which is not an issue as this tablet comes with a Micro to USB cable, so you can use flash drives and USB hard drives as well to load apps and watch movies. I have only hooked a 128GB drive to the machine so I could not tell you the full read capacity for the little tablet. When playing movies off USB there is no noticeable lag time. The Players that come preloaded are junk I recommended the free app MX player as it works in HW.SW and Fast SW mode to convert movies from AC3-Divix formats (Mp4 as well). When watching a movie if the screen brightness is all the way up expect to get through 1 full movie and a little of another movie. With the settings low to half way two movies should be within the spec of this tablet.Alright for web browsing, it comes preloaded with Google Chrome, which I've had no issue using. All my pages allow me to sync perfectly to them, along with all my book marks. The push to laptop function works well and no complaints. I've not used the YOU TUBE app yet as I just use YouTube in desktop mode on the Chrome browser with no complaints.I've not use nor do I have a need for the GPS function so I will skip that however Google maps worked well for me and it found my location at home just as fast as my Acer A500 and my Galaxy S3 did; when using share location or Find my Device it picks my location up within 500Ft of the device which is good for a FREE app. Again works well but never used the Driving part of the GPS.Amazon Kindle reading app works well although some of the text is hard to read without zooming it. Again it's not unreadable however if you wear glasses like me it could be a bit of a challenge for you. But as this is a true 5 point Multi touch all zooming gestures work well.Playing Angry birds or other games this tablet works well and does not kill your arms to hold it up. The 5 point Multitouch works excellent and the screen which seems to be MVA(multidomain vertical alignment) allowing you to see pretty good detail in the game. Not as good as an IPS but again price is a factor here. When playing with your friends everyone can see the screen as the off viewing angles are decent, they compare to most mid 2000's laptop's.Now the only bad I could find about this thing, is the Lack of space on the 8GB version, 8-16 GB of internal memory (storage) is really too little these days. But it does have an expansion slot that offers another 32GB of space per card you use, and remember you can save movies to USB as well as an external drive or Google Cloud.So to wrap up this review if you need a cheap Sub $100.00 tablet for use with work, entertainment or just to have to get into the world of tablets this is an excellent buy, as it supports most games and the movie quality is good (Worst being cheap Micro Cruz tablets, Better being Mid pad tablet, Good being Pipo-S1, Best being A500 and Outstanding being Asus /Galaxy S) Google Chrome is excellent and reading/watching daily news is not as great as a 10 inch but better than using most smart phones. I would give this product 9 out of 10 only due to small battery and low internal storage (they do offer a 16GB version as well). I will try to post an English speaking video (USA so I should say American version) soon to go along with my review. Again I try to keep this simple and semi short, but if you want something that works well and is not over priced buy one of these you will be surprised at this little 7 inches power.Side note: All 3-D games I've tried work well and the G-accelerator seems to be very responsive no lag.

This isn't some cheap piece of plastic (everything is metal except the adjustment knobs and wheels) like you'd normally expect for around $35.The main body is a very solid slab of aluminum that will easily support any DSLR, even with a battery grip. I even cradled a full size professional ENG video camera (the big kind that goes on your shoulder) on the unit, facing inline with the wheels with the shoulder mount sitting between the axles. The platform held it with no issues and it rolled perfectly smooth across the floor. With my DSLR, I was able to use a monopod head on it to not only raise it up a bit, but allow me to angle the camera in any direction.The wheels roll smoothly, though the bearings aren't as smooth as they could be to allow the wheels to spin freely. They don't bind or anything, but you don't get that &#34;infinite spin&#34; that good bearings give you. The unit does roll smoothly, though I'm finding the same thing to be true with this as with tripods and full size dollies: more weight on it makes it move more smoothly, especially on carpet. During long moves, more weight allowed for more consistent speeds, too.With this dolly, you can turn both sets of wheels in any direction, so geometric arcs are pretty simply to achieve. However, this is where I subtract a star.While the base plate does have angle markings, they're only tic marks with no actual listings of the actual angle. While the actual angle may not be as important as what works for the shot, having the hashes labled with a numerical value would make it easier to quickly match the settings on both axles. As it is, you have to count how many hashes in one axle is set at so you can count and set the other one at the same spot.In addition, the unit could really benefit from catches at the 0 degree mark and maybe at every 5 degrees to make setting the dolly up quicker - especially when trying to return the wheels to the straight position. Doing so is complicated by the hex-shaped axles that obscure the hashes you're trying to align to.One nice thing about the unit is it appears (aside from the main plate), the hardware is pretty much off the shelf, so customizing or replacing parts should be easy enough. Getting the exact knobs on the unit might be harder, but I've seen that sort of thing in hardware stores. Since those have plastic grips, they would be the most vulnerable to breakage. The screws are standard hex screws, so you can replace them if you strip them.I bought my unit with the DMKFoto Heavy Duty Ball Head with Quick Release Plate for monopods (Fancier part number FT-001H) and a pack of 1/4&#34; to 3/8&#34; screw adapters to fit the head to the standard tripod screw on the dolly. The addition of the ball head makes the dolly far more versatile, so I really recommend it.Overall, the dolly is a great value and seems very easy to modify for individual uses. Aside from my gripes above, I'd definitely recommend it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent quality and value, though not quite perfect.", "unixReviewTime": 1383091200, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2013"}

Sherman wakes up when I open the case, except when I forget to charge him, like now.  Grr.  There are magnets all over this case to hold Sherman in without covering up the sides of the screen with straps, which is great because I like to get Decal Girl skins to dress up my toys, and the magnets let me see the design.  The camera turns on when I slide Sherman up in the case, but I think it's silly to use him as a camera.And as advertised, the covering flap folds to use as a stand.  It actually took me a while to consistently fold it properly.  It's not hard - it's just that sometimes I'm not as smart as I think I am.I got this through the Vine program.  I probably would have given it 4 stars if I hadn't already gone through several cheap cases.  If I had bought this, I would have picked the red one, but the black one is super nice.

Often, the camera or tripod pedestal, or something else prevents full 360 degree rotation, therefore, the lever is spring loaded so you can pull it out, to allow free rotation without moving the screw. This allows you to tighten and loosen the grip even when you have limited clearance. Well, this often does not work, because the lever requires you to pull it out way too much to clear the hex head, it barely clears at all, so when you rotate the handle it is still engaging the screw. In my application there is not enough room to grab the tightening lever and pull it out to the very limit of it's maximum movement (also it takes a lot of effort because of the increasing spring tension). The brass hex screw head (only visible when you pull the lever out) which must be engaged to tighten or loosen the clamping is way too long!  I compared the length of the brass hex head to the one supplied on the Manfrotto MVH502AH Pro Video head. That one works just right because the screw head is about a fourth or a third the length, so with a much shorter pull there clearance to rotate the knob without engaging the tightening screw. Either this 577 was designed poorly, or the manufacturer failed to use wrong brass hex head screw.I swapped out the tightening knob/screw unit from the MVH502AH and with the one that came with the Manfrotto 3433PL 577 and then it works the way it should.I'm thinking of returning this for a replacement but I'm worried that the replacement might be just as bad. I might instead disassemble it and shorten the brass hex head. I should not have to \"repair it\".  Obviously, there is not sufficient Quality Control by Manfrotto. Someone should have noticed that this does not work too well in practice.The reason that this item gets very good reviews must be either that few of the reviewers have clearance problems (with the bottom of their camera or a mounting plate beneath the camera, OR that their sample came with the proper \"short hex head\" tightening screw.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Design or fabrication problem", "unixReviewTime": 1398902400, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2014"}

It has AM/FM/WX bands and they all work better than almost any other radio I own. The volume can get pretty high--at least 75-80dB measured from a distance of a couple inches from the speaker. The speaker does not have the greatest sound quality, but I've heard much worse too. The tuning knob has a satisfying soft click with each incremental movement. It doesn't come with an AC adaptor, but a lot of common 6 volt AC adaptors will work as long as they're positive-polarity and the plug fits. I used a cord from a Delphi Roady2 XM radio. I've also cranked the dynamo (before charging it on AC power). I haven't tried regular batteries in it, but I may never have to, given how long this radio holds a charge.I live almost exactly halfway between Milwaukee and Chicago, and while it might seem like I'd have all sorts of choices for radio listening because of two major metro radio markets, the truth is that it can be tricky to pick up stations here. Chicago and Milwaukee are each at least 40-50 miles away, depending on the exact location of the transmitters, so neither market comes in exceptionally clear without a great antenna (same problem here for over-the-air HDTV). Even my Midland weather alert radio has trouble picking up the 2 or 3 local weather frequencies. This little bugger picks up all of them VERY clearly; one of them sounds like it's broadcasting a mile away on this RadioShack radio, whereas the same weather station sounds like it's 30 miles from here on the Midland. FM is pretty exceptional as well, often getting stations in clearly that other much higher-priced receivers can't get.For those listeners in the same area (far northern Lake County IL), a couple such difficult-to-receive stations from Chicago are 98.7 WFMT, 96.3 WBBM, 100.3 WILV, 94.7 WLS and 93.9 WLIT. Although I don't listen to all of those stations, I sometimes use them to aim antennas because they tend to be harder to get. From Milwaukee, some I have trouble getting on more expensive receivers are 94.5 WLWK, 95.7 WRIT, 97.3 WRNW, 99.1 WMYX and 102.1 WLUM.For you DXers, where this radio really shines is on the AM band (most DXers wouldn't use an emergency dynamo-powered radio for that purpose, but this one is pretty good at it). For years growing up in central Indiana, I could easily receive two major NYC stations at night--770 WABC and 880 WCBS. However, after moving much closer to Chicago, I haven't been able to receive those two stations even at night because there are local stations right next door on the tuning dial: 780 WBBM and 890 WLS. This radio picks them up. I was able to clearly receive 650 WSM from Nashville TN, 700 WLW from Cincinnati OH and 750 WSB from Atlanta GA without even trying too hard. It's much easier to pick up  lower power local AM stations during the daytime with this radio because the frequency separation is that good. I haven't experienced any bleedover from stronger stations.The handy USB port on the back will charge my power-hungry Samsung Galaxy S4 (albeit not completely). You're probably not going to charge a smartphone's battery more than a few percent unless you want to turn the crank on this thing for hours, but it will do nicely in a pinch. I don't have an iPhone, so I don't know whether it will charge those--they seem to be pickier about the minimum amount of current required to charge. And forget about charging an iPad or tablet. I measured a stable 4.98-5.02 volts and 0.26-0.35 amps. I don't know how long the charge in the built-in rechargeable battery would last, but I wouldn't be surprised to get 5-10% of a charge to my Galaxy S4 out of it.The flashlight isn't the brightest--I measured a fairly dim 2500-3000 lux at a distance of about 1-2 inches from the bulb, perhaps about the brightness of an LED night light. If you take this radio camping (as it has a great weather band and the USB charger), the light should be enough to see the path from your tent to wherever you have to go to do your business. The handle is great too--makes it easy to aim the flashlight and/or hang it from a tree branch--you're only limited by your own creativity.I really must say that I'm impressed with the quality of this radio, especially for the price. No, I didn't buy it here on Amazon, but rather on a leading auction site. Sometimes the price is about the same, but at 11-14 clams, it's a great bargain. It might be worth double that to someone who appreciates an all-in-one radio/USB charger/flashlight or something that gets great reception during a power outage.

Reeck", "helpful": [37, 37], "reviewText": "I recently acquired this camera and it has received mixed reviews around the web and not so good reviews here on Amazon. But after having spent some time with this camera, I have a very positive impression of it. Instead of blowing up the picture to 500 percent and looking for purple fringing, I looked at it from the aspect of \"how good is an 8 by 10 printout? And, \"How good does it look on a TV or a computer screen? Real issues and not the technical aspects of the output.And to me, the photos it takes are excellent. Crisp and clean, with good color representation - not extreme or unnatural. The pictures have a decent amount of blowup range before becoming pixelated. Slightly ;less than a decent SLR, but still good. The flash is a bit underpowered, but still is sufficient for most needs. The touch screen is a superb idea. Most people won't bother with the manual comtrols of a point and shoot becasue they are usually buried in menus and difficult to get to. But the on screen system used here makes it very easy (and quick) to get to common manual controls. This is the first point and shoot camera that I felt like even bothering with the manual controls.The video also seems to work and look fine. The 320 by 240, 60 frames per second output doesn't look much different than the 640 by 480 30 frames per second movie, other than the obvious resolution difference. But the 640 resolution looks sharp and with good color and is playable on most decently powered computers.The camera also has a 1280 by 720 High Defintion (720p) resolution. It plays well on the camera, but you need a fairly powerful PC or Mac to play it on, and even then it's a bit jerky. But that's the fault with HD on a computer and not a camera problem. But the camera does not include an HD cable for connection to a TV (just RCA and USB cables are included) and that's a major downpoint since you must buy a fairly expensive dock to do that. A very bad call on Samsung's part. I also did not experience any lockups of strange problems that someone in Amazon have reported.

The size of this unit is compact enough to fit in a pocket for easy carrying around. It produces high quality sound provided that you use a high quality set of head phones. You can manage your of collection of songs and data easily via your PC by using the familiar windows explorer. The USB interface setup is quite straightforward and I was able to get it up and running within a few minutes. There are quite a few things which I would consider as less than perfect. First of all, the user manuel is poorly written. Many valuable information is missing (most of it can be found, however, in the Archos support FAQ site). The battery compartment door is poorly designed. If you follow the manual's instructions to pry open the cover with a screw driver, chances are that you would damage the plastic surrounding it. However, you could easily open the battey compartment door by graping the 3 notches on the side of the cover with your fingers and lift it up. The control of the features on the MP3 player is mainly done by scrolling through an on-screen menu, which would be less convenient than having a separate dial control for the volume or for searching. However, there are many great features on the menus which allow you to control the sound quality and songs play back. The unit does not allow recording even though a line-in jack is provided. If you want to delete songs on the player, you would need to do it through the windows explorer on the PC. I have also tried to backup about 1.5 Gbyte of my work data. The unit ran into a few underrun problems and that not all files were backed up. I  found out later that the problem was caused by low batteries voltage. You definitely should connect the charger to the unit for data backup. When you disconnect the jukebox from the PC, I strongly recommend that you use windows to eject the hardware (for windows 98, click on My Computer; right click on the drive icon; then click Eject) rather than simply unplugging the USB cable. I suspect that many people who complained about hard disk errors did not follow this procedure.

Using my old router as a switch ( being 100mb) I was worried that this router would default to 100mb like a few other gigabit routers out there that refuses to mix connections, but it didn't and my 1gb connections run at advertised speed. So far it hasn't had a hiccup, no random drops (wired or wireless).All in all for the price it works just fine and was very easy to setup. Only downside is no dd-wrt support at the moment ( well I haven't checked today so don't call me a liar).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Easy easy and cheap", "unixReviewTime": 1269561600, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2010"}

First off this tablet is fast. It also is capable of performing well even when you have numerous apps running at the same time. It is a very slim tablet with a large 8\" screen. The border is very small which gives you even more viewing area. It seem much larger than my older 7\" tablet. The screen resolution is decent for a tablet that costs less than $200. The Dell Venue has large internal storage capabilities. It sports 32 GB of on board storage which allows you to download many apps to your device. There is no need to worry about running out of space. I found that if you put too many apps on a device with lower storage capabilities it tends to run very slow and sluggish. This tablet does have an external SD storage slot. This helps to eliminates having to store music, videos and pictures on the device itself. One area that could be improved on this tablet are the speakers. This is not the best tablet to buy if you plan on listening to a lot of loud music without headphones or external powered speakers. The speakers are a little weak. The only other area I would improve on is adding a HDMI port so you could hook it up to a TV and be able watch your videos and movie. I solved this problem by adding an app that just throws the video to the TV with no wires. I have tried many tablets under $200 and found this tablet to have the best features for the money. I would not think twice about buying or recommending this tablet. Look for specials and you can find this Dell for a lot less than $200. I choose this over the Dell Venue Pro because I already have a laptop that runs Windows and I wanted to run on Android. This tablet runs on Android 4.3 so it is still very current. Buying Android allows you to pick apps from the Google Play Store. The Google Play Store has so many great apps to pick from that you need an app just show you which apps are the best. Which I have.

The most noticeable is the larger LCD, scene modes for those who don't like to tinker with the settings, \"C\" dial position to save your custom settings, and the print/share button to make things easier.  For those who don't know, scene modes are easy-to-access presets of a combination of manual adjustments, optimized for shooting in different situations such as when you are indoors, at the beach, taking shots of kids, shooting at night, or shooting fireworks, etc. The camera features full manual controls over shutter speed and aperture, manual focus, saturation, exposure compensation, custom white balance, ISO, metering, and a histogram in playback mode.  I know most people think they won't ever use some of these, but when you have an important shot that just isn't coming out, you'll be really glad you have it (or wish you did).  For those who don't know, control over shutter speed means you can use a fast shutter speed to capture fast action or you can use a slow shutter to avoid using a flash or for taking shots of night scenery.The areas where the Canon A75, A85, and A95 really excel at are:Being fairly small(small price tag too!) for a camera with this many features and having picture quality this good.Creative shooting:  this is a great camera for those who want to do creative shooting but can't afford to plop down $600+ for a Canon G6 or more for a Digital SLR.  It's got all of the most important controls, and with your memory card, you can do all the creative shooting and experimenting you want virtually free compared to using film.  It's even expandable with telephoto, wide angle, or close up conversion lenses and there's also the waterproof casing.All Canon cameras also come with an excellent software package that lets you stitch panoramic photos, retouch photos or rescue those that came out wrong, add special effect, and view thumbnails of pictures so you don't have to open them up to see what the picture looks like (good for those who are using an older version of windows, I know there are still a lot of you out there).  The best part is that it's free!  It does more than Kodak's software(which is pretty decent), you have to pay $20 to get the better version of Olympus's software, and Sony's editing software is pretty much non-existent.  Those who already have Photoshop won't be excited.For those of you who are concerned that the camera doesn't come with rechargeable batteries, don't worry, it's really not a big deal.  Good rechargeable AA's, type NiMH are super cheap at around $10-$15 for 4, compared to $50 for Lithium Ion battery packs, and at that price, everyone can afford a spare set, which is really important to have.  I've seen people who bought much crappier cameras at the same price, just because they came with rechargeable batteries - not a smart choice in my opinion.Yes, there is the problem with purple fringing, but it's not a very common problem and most people either don't know what it is or don't even know think it's much of a problem when they see it.  Some people think it looks cool.  With full control over aperture, you have the ability to get rid of it or at least reduce it.  Compared to the problems that other manufacturers have with their cameras, I'd take a bit of purple fringing over noise, soft/fuzzy images, and over-sharpening any day!If you want 5 megapixels of resolution, a very useful rotating LCD screen, and Flexi-Zone (lets you choose an area that is off-center to focus on), then look at the A95.Please note:  my review of the A75 is the same as the A85 because they are pretty much the same camera with the 1 megapixel different.

I don't feel a need to get an HDMI receiver.The only problem I ran into so far was with some 4:3 aspect ratio DVD's.  To play these properly you need to set one of the player's settings to \"Fixed Aspect Ratio\".  Although this worked on some DVD's, it didn't work on others.  I found that if you just press stop and then play again, it would adjust to the correct aspect ratio.  I don't know if this is the player's fault or the DVD.  Maybe a firmware upgrade witll fix it.  The work around is not that big of a deal anyway.  UPDATE: The latest firmware did fix this problem.Blu-Ray picture quality is great, of course.  But I was impressed that even DVD's look better.

Okay, I must admit I was nervous after reading some negative reviews, however, thus far the product is operating as stated. You have the three receivers, each takes two triple A batteries. The transmitter does not use any batteries or cords to operate, once you attach it to your camera shoe, it uses power directly from the camera. How will this affect the power source of the camera, I cannot adequately say, only time will tell if this receiver drains your camera battery. There doesn't appear to be any sort of delays between transmitter and receiver, so far my max distance has been ten feet.Update. The ability to have your flash attached to wireless and position it somewhere and you have the ability to manuver is priceless.  This product gives ypu the freedom to create portraits with amazing shadow contrast and detail as if using light setups just because you have the freedom to move and station flash somewhere else. Other ppl have complained about problems I havent had any, however I believe I may know why some ppl have problems. I have two external flashes...one sppedlight ttl 520 the other bower. The speedlight connects well and receives input quickly and since thecycle is quick you can get numerous flashes back to back. The bower however is slower and requires constant input by transmitter....I have to tap the button atop transmittet to have bower activate. The cycle is slow so I take a shot and wait a full second before taking another shot. So of tpu dont have speedlight flash you may have problems.The product feels cheaply made, so I recommend you keep the plastic baggy it comes with or find somewhere to store your receivers that has some cushion.

Noise-cancelling is an active process that involves the headphones generating sound waves of their own to cancel out extraneous noise, which means that the headphones are big, expensive, and require batteries.

I usually use them on my netbook and find they put out an decent volume of sound of impressive quality.I'm not saying they will satisfy audiophiles. These are, after all, relatively inexpensive USB speakers without a lot of bass.  But I was impressed today when I moved my Altec Lansing speakers from the desktop computer I'm using to write this to the computer I use with my music synthesizer and temporarily replaced the Altec on this computer with the Logitech USB.  It doesn't have the bass or volume of the Altec speakers, but it does have as much volume as I need in my small office and quite good sound quality.To get the best volume and sound quality, I open up the Windows Sound window.  Depending on how your Windows PC is configured, there will be one of two ways for you to do this.  First click the Start button and then Control Panel.  If you see a vertical menu list of items, scroll down to Sound and click that; if you see two columns of categories, click Hardware and Sound and then click Sound. Here you'll find options that should improve your listening experience with these speakers.It's on a netbook or laptop that these speakers really shine.  If you've been using a standard netbook or laptop speaker, these will be heaven to you.My only complaint is that the USB cord is short.  It's no problem on my netbook or on my ancient Thinkpad, but for some larger laptops, it could be an issue.  Otherwise, if you're looking for inexpensive USB speakers, it's hard to beat these.  I was going to add \"portable\" to that list, but after listening to them just now on this desktop and playing with the Windows Sound window to tweak it, they also make decent, though not ideal, speakers for a desktop.  The short USB cord can be a problem when using it with a desktop, but a USB extension cable can remedy this.I'll still order larger speakers, probably another set of Altec Lansings, to replace the ones I moved to the other desktop computer, but in the meantime, I don't mind listening to this Logitech, and I love it when I'm on my netbook.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I don't often say \"awesome\", but these are... awesome", "unixReviewTime": 1325894400, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2012"}

It takes its time to wind down but in my case no longer than it takes my system to boot up,  So i am happy with it.  I also think the controlled speed should reduce the chance of binding during rewind.I don't have anything bad to say about the screen.  The mounting points are at the end of the screen which gives you a few options but it is possible to have a arrangement where you will not be on studs - like I was - and I think you want to mount this screen to the wall studsm it is not too heavy, I installed it myself,  I built a housing that would &#34;hide&#34; the screen and using basic baseboard trim pieces along the front and sides and a 3/4&#34; thick piece of pine on top, I had it looking like it belonged just below my crown molding.  I attached the housing with some L brackets to the wall studs and then attached the screen to the pine of the housing.Very pleased with the result", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very nice unit", "unixReviewTime": 1362700800, "reviewTime": "03 8, 2013"}

Don't get me wrong, the Canon IS better, but $300 better? Absolutely not. My first Yongnuo was bought as a cheap second unit for a specific job that I didn't want to invest too much in. It has, since then, become my primary unit. I have two 430 EXII units that I use as backups now.My concern with most low price alternatives from China are usually quality related. This flash has taken several spills already (see my upcoming review of my new sandbags to avoid that) and hasn't skipped a beat. It's build quality is EXCELLENT. I can't say that part enough.So what do you give up from the Canon? For starters, ETTL. I don't use it, so I don't miss it. Canon 600EX zooms to 200mm, Yongnuo zooms only to 105mm. I believe the Canon trigger system used in the 600 are superior, but I used a pocket wizard type product anyway, so that isn't a deal breaker for me.At the end of the day, this flash can be delivered to your door for $85, versus $400 for the Canon equivalent.

Boot up and in about a month you begin to get dire warnings that your subscription is about to expire and reminders to go to their web site and get the key to unlock the full edition.  Note: You're better off getting a disk copy of whatever you decide to use for your anti-virus software, because you pay a good deal of money to download it, only to lose it sometime later (unless you want ot pay $10 extra to keep an archived copy out in cyber space for future use, when your computer crashes--possibly from the very viruses you've bought this miserable program to fend off).Why did I purchase this program? Because I've tried taking off Norton's programs and managed each time to take out something necessary to some other operational programs.  Amazon offered Norton CHEAP in a gold box special. If (unlike me) you can get rid of Norton altogether, I advise you go online and find something in the freeware.  Norton is a pain in the pocket book and a drag on the operating system all round.I put off installing this disk as long as I dared. It's never ever as 'simple' as the directions insist.  I had to install it, have it stall, uninstall it, and re-install before I got it functioning.  And as usual, installing this version further slowed down my computer's actions.The way it works is, you buy a computer which is blazing fast compared with what you had before. Over the years there are many updates automatic and otherwise, and there are re-subscriptions to antivirus programs.  Each change changes the computer, until 5 years later you can do just about the same as it does mechanically, with pen and paper.It's my theory that if we stripped our operating systems of all but the barest essentials in updates and anti-virus/system maintenance programs, computers would perform with the 'blazing speed' advertised in their spec sheets.If you are not a geek, and you don't want to pay for a geek, this may suit your purposes.  It's a rip off, but at least Amazon offers it for a better price than Norton or some of its distributers.  This is why I gave it the high mark of 1 star.

But if you are looking for a simple corded shutter release, save your money and get this one.  Sure, it doesn't feel as sturdy as the more expensive ones; but how sturdy does a simple button have to be to make a shutter release?  This one is just as good quality as the Nikon simple shutter release, but after using it several times I think it is probably better than Nikon's (I'm not a gentle person when it comes to remotes).  It has worked perfect on my D300 in both my studio and travels, and fits comfortably in my hand.  I use it for night shots (lots of night shots) and product studio long exposures.  As an example, I used this remote to make most of the photos used on CompassRoseGeocoin.com.  I could not have any camera shake when taking those photos.Update: I ended up losing the first one of these I purchased after using it for several hundred photos (It was much sturdier than I thought).  I wasn't too upset since the cost was so low, but I would have been livid if I were to lose one of those more expensive remotes.  After finding out of the loss, I did more research to see if there are any new options for remotes; but this remote still seems to be the best value on the market today.

However, it seems that the components were not originally designed specifically for one another. The light holder, for instance, is designed to mount on the top of a metal shaft by means of a screw clamp. But the top of the light stand has a screw that points upward, and the only way I could determine to mount the holder is by clamping it onto the threads of the  stand's screw -- it cannot be positioned lower, onto the shaft, where it would be more appropriate. It works, but not optimally. In another instance, the shaft of the umbrella is constructed of lightweight tubular steel. It is held in position by another screw clamp on the light holder. But when clamping it down, the screw will easily crush the tubular steel. I overcame this problem by temporarily removing the aluminum cap at the bottom of the umbrella's shaft and inserting a 15\" long, 1/4\" diameter wooden dowel into the tube. I can now apply adequate pressure to satisfactorily secure the umbrella.You might gather from these problems that I don't recommend this purchase, but actually I'm quite happy with it. Compared to other sets, it's an amazing value. The use of color-balanced compact florescent bulbs makes a lot of sense (unless you require intense illumination).

So, I have an MBR1200 which was plagues with problems from the start.  It eventually stopped working all together at only about 9 months old. Anyway, I decided to downsize to a smaller device and connect it to a faster router using the WAN port, and I went with cradlepoint again noticing that they changed the operating system in their new devices and I figured they might have eliminated some of the bugs from the previous device.  Now, I've had no \"hardware\" issues like my mbr1200 did, except for it not liking my data stick. I'm using the T-Mobile Rocket(tm) 2.0 Data Stick (ZTE MF691) which is on their compatibility list.  The MBR1200 hated it and this CTR35 is no exception.  Now, I've got 2 of these sticks and they both act the same so I'm pretty sure it's the router and not the stick. The CRT35 will ONLY see the data stick if it is inserted AFTER it's boot process.  Otherwise it will report in the logs that there was a problem detected on the USB port and it will shut it down.  It will ever try again from there. So, if you lose power, your connection will not come back up.  You have to pull the stick, boot, and put it back it.  This also works only some of the time.  I've occasionally had to reboot again, and re-insert the stick as once it starts reporting there is a problem with the port, it will always report it no matter what. A Reboot usually fixes it.Also, some of the cool features in the router don't work well with this stick. The MBR1200 was the same way.  There is a keep alive function that will auto detect if the device stops responding, and it will force a hard reset of the port and try to get it to come back up.  Well, it always detects a problem and will keep rebooting your data stick over and over on whatever detection schedule you have set.  The MBR did this too.  There is no difference between its detection and Aggressive detection. They work the same.  Constant resets.  You can also tell it to use an outside source to ping so that if it can't ping the site, it assumes it's down and will reset it.  This doesn't work either.  It still resets if even if you can ping from a computer connected to it.

I tried to burn a 36GB file using a new LG Burner BE14NU40 and Nero 2014 software on the 2 year old (USB 2.0) Dell i3 Desktop.  It failed when data was already burned to disk but being verified.I'm still troubleshooting why the &#34;verify write&#34; keeps failing after each 50GB burn while using Nero 2014.  One of the two 'failed' disks actually works if I pop it back into the Bluray tray and copy the single file to an area on the hard drive.  I was able to use the  file later when I had copied it OK and did some testing.  Put another way, the integrity of the write for one of the 2 disks is OK, but each time I try to repeat the same process for the second 50GB burn I did tonight, the copy process (from Bluray to Hard drive) fails at 66%, complaining of a bad cluster on the Bluray.  So, I guess this is my first genuine coaster!  It could be Windows and Bluray are not getting along, as the file is the largest I've tried to work with so far.Sorry if I am a little too technical for some of you.  Just be mindful that not all brands are created equal.  Not only do you have to consider the bluray hardware being used (with up-to-date firmware, etc.), but the transfer and read/write rates you can get via USB 2.0 or 3.0, as well as (of course) the media you use to burn the data.As soon as I have been able to figure out what's going on with my experiences, I will update this review.  I may even buy another brand, especially if someone out there can recommend ones that work with my LG Burner???", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "I'm not having much luck with this Brand", "unixReviewTime": 1393977600, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2014"}

It isn't an Obsession UC22\" Dobsonian. I own both of the aforementioned scopes.  Plus a Tak FSQ106EDXIII. I am an amateur astronomer.  Heck, I even have my own domed observatory in the back yard. So I didn't expect this little scope to afford views like I was accustomed to.I bought the scope for my neighbors 8 year old son. But before I passed it along to him, I decided to try it out on the Heavens. Out of the box I was far from impressed. Sure, it is only a 3\" reflector. But the optic problems it was plagued by were enormous. The eyepieces are crap, sad to say. But worst of all, the optic train is even worse, at least my model.Most reflectors have the ability to collimate the optics. That is, align everything with respect to the eyepiece.  This scope does not. No way to move the primary mirror, and only \"fake\" alignment screws on the secondary mirror. On top of all this, the secondary mirror (the mirror that reflects the image from the primary to the eyepiece) was installed crooked.  This definitely didn't help any.First thing I did was remove the secondary (small) mirror from the focuser and re-glue it so that it was lined up better.  This was done by \"eyeballing\" but it made a vast difference in the view. Easy to do with some contact cement. This is about all you can do to help the optics in this little scope. This may have just been my scope, but I didn't have time to send it back.Once I made this change, I was impressed.  Remember, you're not going to get Hubble views out of this scope.  Even after the fix there was a lot of astigmatism and coma in the eyepiece.  Stars showed lots of pincushion artifacts just outside of the center field. But when I trained the scope on the Orion Nebula, there it was! With a bit of averted vision (not looking directly at the object, but sort of off to one side) I was treated with the classic nebulosity. The Pleiades were brilliant, and I was easily able to make out the shape of the Andromeda Galaxy. Jupiter's four big moons were obvious, though the cloud bands took some imagination (but there was light thin clouds disturbing my view from Earth). The Moon was very impressive.  Even when I changed to the 4mm ocular, the Moon showed lots of detail that should make any kid bubble with joy. The craters were very impressive. Though I did not see myself, I am sure the rings of Saturn would be easily visible.I remember, as a ten year old, looking at Saturn with my brothers 60mm Sears refractor. I was enthralled and it set the stage for a life long desire to explore the Heavens. Since then I've owned an Edmund Astroscan and 6\" reflector, two Celestron C8's, a C11, a home made 13.1\" Dobsonian reflector, and my current Takahashi refractors, and my new 22\" Obsession scope. All of this because of my first back yard views with a Sears piece of junk. This scope is far better in my opinion. Remember, you're not necessarily getting a top notch telescope. The build overall is impressive however. A finderscope would be nice, but I had pretty good luck just sighting down the tube and hunting. But a scope like this might just be the one thing to spark curiosity in a young mind. And there just isn't much of that going around these days.If you have a youngster that you think might like an introduction to the night sky, this is the perfect little gem. Sure, far from perfect, and might even need a bit of tweaking if you are brave enough.

To some this may not matter but to me I was a bit shocked as I got one for someone as a gift. And as a gift its nice to have full retail packaging and graphics.I will do a quick review to compare the IM-237.The unit is almost identical to my IMT-228 the 228 has a more modern color with black and orange that looks pretty slick, while the 237 has a gray and silver body, BOTH COME WITH CASES.The differences I note are in construction the 237 uses what appears to be an aluminum speaker mount, TOP  BODY, where the 228 has a plastic speaker mount, now this may be what makes them sound slightly different due to the materials each is built around. I feel that the 237 has just a little bit solider bottom end but not a lot.They both sound quite clear and defined for the size of the driver, although the driver is no bigger then what most clock radios have in them, This does not in any way sound like a cheep clock radio speaker as one may expect. It actualy has nice clear shimmering highs with pretty good bottom and excellent vocal quality, again for its size it is quite impressive in my opinion.My reason for adding my review with the following info, is based on the fact I also own a IMT-228 that did come in full retail packaging from a different seller also fulfilled by Amazon.The item I purchased did appear to be brand new but only came in a uline corrugated shipping box not with full retail packaging. Nowhere do I see it mentioned that this is a warehouse type deal and does not come in full retail packaging.Note to Amazon please verify that if a seller fulfilled by Amazon is selling the item without full retail packaging, I feel this should be noted. I see no mention of that at this point. Again if it's a gift one may care about this, if not I am sure most will be fine ... it does come with the case, batteries and everything it should.I hope this will help others decide what Orbit to buy :-)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice Speaker Overall", "unixReviewTime": 1371772800, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2013"}

It's got some flaws but it's great for being $300.  I like that it has a numeric keypad which I really missed on my old Dell laptop but that shifts the keyboard about 1 key to the left.  It took me a little while to get the hang of it but now I usually have my hands in the right position for typing.  It boots up quickly.  I did have some lag multitasking - multiple tabs open in firefox, spotify, and a hidden object game running.  It only lag while I was searching for music on spotify.  Everything worked fine if I'm just streaming music.  I love love love the battery life compare to my old laptop.  I get at least 4 hours per charge.  It also doesn't overheat like crazy (I got burns from my old one).  I had really wanted to get a tablet but that's mostly just a bigger version of my smartphone without the phone so since the laptop was on sale I used the money on this instead.  It's not that heavy and I use this on the couch while watching netflix on my TV.  In conclusion, I think I made a good purchase and I dont regret not saving my money for a tablet.  Will update review if needed.Update 5/25/12:Still doing ok.  I did notice that it lag a bit when my antivirus was updating but no biggie.  I had forgotten to mention I couldn't find a physical volume control button which can be slightly annoying when I decide to change volume in the midst of a full screen game.  However, lazy old me finally decide to take a closer look at the keyboard and voila.  I just need to hold down the \"Fn\" key while using the up and down arrows.  There's also a nice pause key which is also the Home key. Please do not accidentally disable your touchpad like I did trying out the F buttons. I also tried the webcam.  It's really clear even in low lighting not like one I had in the prehistoric ages =]The touchpad is a little finicky.  So there's an up and down scrolling area on the right side of it which works great.  There's apparently an invisible left and right scrolling area on the bottom.  The problem is that the area isn't clearly define and I could be quite far from the bottom edge when the scrolling kicks in.  It made me keep losing my page while reading an e-book on amazon's cloud reader.  I guess you can always plug in a mouse if you're doing work where this would be a problem.Update 6/12/12:I figured out the touchpad side scrolling issue.  Go to the trackpad icon on the taskbar. Under the Elan tab on mouse properties you click options.  That will show you the different gestures you can use.  Click on edge scrolling and uncheck horizontal.I haven't had the issue of the cd drive popping out like others have.  It's only done it once even with me holding it on the side and sometimes leaning it on it's side.  I have to wonder how other people are holding theirs.

Turner", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "I bought mine when the price was about $400, but compared to any UHD/4K \"monitors\" this display would still be a steal if it cost twice as much.- First thing, you need to make sure your video card can actually handle 4k output. I did some research in advance and found my old AMD radeon 5850 didn't support 4k, so I picked up a new nVidia card that did (GTX 760). I've been using AMD cards for almost 20 years, but they're going for stupidly inflated prices right now, so you'll probably find better deals in the nVidia family.- Initial picture quality on first boot looks really blown out and over-saturated.-- step 1: Don't waste your time messing with the settings, go directly to the Seiki website and download the Seiki 39\" firmware labeled \"with backlight and temp\". I tried the 50\" firmware as others had suggested, but this caused my display to start blinking out at random. Follow the instructions on the Seiki page. [...] - update - you may need to go into the advanced menu and manually choose to upgrade the firmware from the usb drive-- step 2: Go into the menu and turn the sharpness down to 0, and with the new firmware you can also decrease the backlight and further tweak the color settings. The advanced (factory) menu can be reached by pressing menu on the remote, then entering 0,0,0,0. Under \"Factory Menu\" -> \"Others\" -> \"Other Setting\" scroll all the way down (to a second page) and you'll find that you can turn the 4-hour standby to \"Off\", this will prevent the monitor from attempting to turn off in the middle of your work or gaming. There are lots of settings in the factory menu that could mess up your display so you should probably use some caution before changing things you don't recognize.-- step 3: If you're on a Windows 7 PC, go to the control panel, choose display, then choose \"adjust cleartype text\" and run through the wizard.-- step 4: If you're using an nVidia video card and the HDMI cable, go to the control panel, choose \"NVIDIA Control Panel\", then under display, choose adjust desktop color settings. Under Digital color format choose YCbCr444 instead of RGB. This should clear up any remaining color issues.---------------------------------------------------------Sure, this display doesn't have boutique level build quality, but for the money it is amazing! It would be even better if the screen was curved and maybe a bit wider aspect ratio, but those features come with a 100x greater pricetag. I know some people have knocked the 30Hz refresh rate, but for desktop apps I haven't noticed any 'lag'. For gaming the screen scales 1080p quite well at up to 120Hz (although it may say you're only at 60Hz). I don't think many developers have actually tested or optimized their games for 4k play yet and good luck finding any commercial background images at the 4k size or websites that scale to fill a full-screen browser window!- updateHad the monitor for about a month now and still love it. It's on the verge of being too big, I rarely use the upper corners, nor do I maximize most programs. Also added instructions for turning off the 4-hour standby, so I no longer need to keep the remote handy. Turning the backlight down to about 56% really helped with eyestrain. Still haven't noticed the 30hz being any sort of limitation, but I haven't done any FPS games at 4k yet. Realistically, I'm going to run most games at 1920x1080 (1080p) which the monitor does nicely at 120hz and that's more in line with what my graphics card can pump out.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Truly amazing computer monitor !

I called Zyxel support but it was not much help. Had to figure out by myself why product was not working as it should (simple answer at the end of this post).I wanted to use the Zyxel as a universal repeater since my main router is too far from my office. When I called support they told me to use another router name for the Zyxel instead of the name of my main router. Big mistake. Called support another time to see if another rep could help me but same result. I was trying to link a Samsung DVD player to the Zyxel and I kept getting the WiFI protected Setup demand on the Samsung so I would push the wps button on the router and nothing would happen. The verdict from both Zyxel and Samsung support was that the router did not support this Samsung DVD Blu-ray player but I digress...Then I checked the driver to make sure I had the latest driver. I had v6 and the latest driver is v7. Thank you Zykel support for not asking me if I had the latest driver installed as your first question when I contacted you. So I went to the Zyxel driver page (which is not that easy to find) and downloaded the latest driver. No excuse for Zyxel to ship router with outdated driver when latest driver came out last November.After installing the driver, I heeded the advice of a previous Zyxel 3205 post (Alan Isherwood on March 13) and changed a few settings as he advised.Now the router works flawlessly except that I cannot set the correct time. It won't let me but it's alright since I don't plan to turn the router on and off.ps.

{"reviewerID": "AT2J7H5TRZM8Z", "asin": "B00005Y3V5", "reviewerName": "A Customer", "helpful": [6, 7], "reviewText": "One of Sony's base line models. With many features at an affordable price. A very competitive model for the market.The Sony Clie Peg-S360 is the succesor to the peg-S320. It contains many of the same feature as the previous one, but has had an upgrade in memory, and also a few other features.It is very light, 4.3 ounces and is also quite thin. It is comfortable and physically easy to use. It displays a plastic silver casing with the four shortcut buttons; date book, adresses, to do list and memo pad. It also contains an 'up-down' button in the centre at the bottom. At the top-left on the side is the jog-dial. On the top you can see the power on/light button aswell as the infra-red, memory stick slot and the stylus holder. The stylus is made of metal with plastic top and pointer. It fits in nicely with only the part showing so that you can easily remove it. On the bottom is the socket used to charge the pda and also the same socket is used to connect the cable to a pc to hotsync.ScreenThe screen is a little darker than some similar handhelds, but i have not really found this a problem. There is a backlight that can be turned on or off by holding in the power button. There is also a contrast adjuster on the lower screen area. Along with this there is a home button, calculator button, menu button and also a serach button. The screen is not to sensitive nor not sensitive enough, so using the graffiti is quite easy to pick up and just start writing.ProcessorWith its 33Mhz Motorola DragonBall processor and 16MB of RAM internal memory it is put in a class with other handhelds, but not in their price range, which is exceptionally good for the first time buyer, because they will not have to start worrying about any upgrades or having to switch to a different pda any time soon.Jog DialThe jog dial is a very handy feature that is now being included in many pda's although not always in the base line ones, like the PEG-S360. The jog dial can be very usefull, for reading through documents, notes etc and also just in general use of the pda. Instead of having to pinpoint the stylus on the small scroll bar, and dragging it down which can sometimes be quite arqward. Aswell as scrolling the jogdial can also be used to select things by pushing it in.MemoryIf you wish to transport other documents or add extra space to the pda a memory stick is very usefull and is included in this pda. It can be used to backup files. IF you have to reset the pda, then a memory stick can be used to back files without having access to a pc. Unfortunately there is not one included with the pda, but they should not be to expensive to purchase.CableYou may ask yourself why then is this so cheap? One of the features that the clie does not have is a cradle. It does instead have a cable which you can use to hotsync, so nothing is lost , apart from your pda will nto be charged at the same time as hotsync so your pda will not sit nicely in a cradle, you will have to place it on a surface instead. The cable that also slots into the same socket to charge thought portable. It's plug folds down to save space.O.SIt comes with Palm O.S 4.0. It is not the latest version of the software, but it is very similar. Other later versions fix remote bugs, which i have not come accross whilst using this pda. One of the extras on this is the attention manager, this is usefull as it reminds you of things where you have set an alarm, but have not acknowledged on your palm yet, so it reminds you.SoftwareThe clie comes with standard palm applications aswell as MS Gate and MS Autorun. MS Gate allows the user to view all the contents that are on the pda's RAM. You can delete and edit things here. MS Autorun allows you to run an application from the memory stick. To multimedia pieces of software included are gMovie and PG Pocket. PG Pocket allows you to view pictures in .bmp and .jpg for example. But because the pda has a monochrome screen this is not brilliant. The Pictures can also be added to the address book to one of your addresses. gMovie allows you to view movies on your pda, again not fantastic. If you are looking for something that can handle this well look into a pda with the 'pocket pc' O.S. Finaly it has Documents To Go. This program allows you to view and edit Microsoft Word and Excel documents.CoverFinnally the Clie includes a flip cover. It is attached at the top by 2 clips. It is not joined at the bottom, so it can easily be 'flipped' over. This provides protection for the screen. Ir also acts as protection on the top for the memory stick slot and the infra red and stylus. It looks stylish, sounds arqward, but its very good and easy to get used to.Pro's- Price- Features- 16MB RAM- Jog Dial- Weight- Good SizeCon's- No Cradle- No O.S 5 Support- Few Additional Accessories.- Non-Conpatible With Windows 95In ConclusionI am a student and this was my first pda buy. I have become very familiar with it and now use it regularly. I am finding it very useful to keep organised and also having a few fun little features aswell. There are many handy applications that you can add for free that you can download from the internet or you can purchase. At this price it is a very good first buy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Organize your life for less!", "unixReviewTime": 1039824000, "reviewTime": "12 14, 2002"}

Because the Palm software is so efficient, that speed is rarely an issue, and you can save a bit by getting the cheaper Deluxe.All Handspring models run variations of the Palm operating system, and have all of the PALM functions people have come to know and love -- addresses, to-do lists, and access to downloadable features like Avantgo (a free service that allows you to download publications like the New York Times, CNN, Sports Illustrated onto your Palm).I've even put a free map of my county on my PDA from Mapopolis.com (a must if you haven't tried it!

They have a noticeably larger screen than the m105 (which I returned after a week), expandability (which I have yet to use, although I long for the GPS attachment from Magellan -- maybe when it goes on clearance?)These models only get four stars, however, because they do have two significant shortcomings.One is bulk. The low-end Deluxe and Neo are significantly larger than the Palm V, which is significantly more expensive.The PDA still fits in my chest pocket, though.Also, unlike the Palm V, 500 and 505, the Deluxe and Neo require new batteries after about two weeks of relatively heavy usage. That can amount to $20 a year or so on batteries alone. The Palm V has a lithium rechargeable, and the new Palm 500 has an even better battery, but I can't justify paying that kind of money for what is still basically, at heart, an appointment calendar.BTW, I am a newspaper reporter who previously had four Rolodexes on my desk.

True, large capacity SSD's could be used in the netbook to greatly increase performance and reliability, but they are relatively hard to find, and generally cost a fortune. For about twenty bucks online, you can purchase a 2GB stick of RAM to go in your netbook. To keep down licensing and manufacturing costs, companies generally only ship with 1GB of RAM. With an Acer, Dell, Toshiba, or other such netbook manufactured in 2010 or 2011, compatibility shouldn't be mach of an issue. Most netbooks and notebooks these days use PC8500 RAM, with 204 pins, which is what this is. Netbooks don't include 2 memory slots, usually, so you can't just install another 1GB stick of RAM. The Atom platform is limited to a maximum of 2GB of RAM, so this might as well be the only option for netbook users. I have changed out RM chips in a majority of netbooks and notebooks, and some brands are easier than others when it comes to upgrading RAM and swapping out parts. Acer users: upgrading the RAM, on certain netbook models, will void your warranty. But, it's sinple enough for most users to do. If you buy a memory chip, but don't feel comfortable doing the upgrade yourself, Staples and other stores offer memory upgrade services. My advice: definitely upgrade the RAM if you want a performance upgrade in your netbook.

If these had retailed for $20, I would have been mightily impressed; conversely, had these been $100 earbuds, I would have considered them to be woefully deficient.  As it is, they perform reasonably well for their price range.A lot of it depends on the music, of course.  I found that amplified or synthesized music was quite well-suited for these earbuds, while the sounds accoustic instruments lost some of the finer details that I desire.  It was almost as though these earbuds were designed to perform a sonic airbrushing on accoustic instruments so as to make them sound more homogenized and synthetic.  The result is a very smooth, non-edgy sound which may actually appeal to people who are more accustomed to the heavily remixed studio sound.  My musical background is on the stage in a symphony orchestra, so when I am listening to Bach for solo violin, by golly, I want to hear the sound of the bow being drawn across the strings.  What appeals to me may be undesireable to others, so this may be a matter of taste.  The earbuds are also a little too bass-heavy for my personal taste, but of course I know I am swimming against the tide on this particular issue.They effectively kill external sound, and the fit is so good that they can quickly create a suction in the ear.  People with some sinus issues, such as myself, may find this to be troublesome at times.  I don't think I would ever want to wear these if I were suffering from a head cold.  People with reasonably unclogged sinuses should find these to be quite comfortable and effective.In general, I was pretty satisfied, once I knew what the price point was.  These worked better for me than some earbuds which were considerably more expensive, but it is worth noting that ultimately I went back to another set of more expensive earbuds which deliver better sound.  For $40 you can do a lot worse; again, I think a lot of it depends on the type of music to which you are listening.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "OK for this price range", "unixReviewTime": 1361923200, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2013"}

When you put it on your keyring, it looks like it is nothing more than the remote for a car alarm.If anyone asks you what it is, you tell them exactly that.  If you have your keys in your hand as you walk through a store, it is not unusual, but just carrying this device by itself might cause suspicion.  PUT IT ON YOUR KEYRING!  Keep your keys in your hand, try not to be too obvious or point your keys at the TV sets!  Keep your arms down at your sides, it has a fairly good range.Going into stores that have large displays of television sets, it is fun to hit the button and watch the sets go off.  Some go off quickly, others take a while as the unit gets to that specific brand.  Some sets can take quite a while to turn off.Sony must be the very first code in this unit, as Sony sets go off imediately.  Panasonic sets take 5 - 10 seconds.At best buy, when brat kids are playing the video games, this unit will turn off the sets so they can't play anymore.The one thing people forget, is that the same signal that turns TV's off, is the same exact signal that also turns TVs ON!!  So if a TV set is off, then using this device will turn it ON.So another great use is when you are at a restaurant and they don't have the TV set on, you can turn the set on, you just can't change channels and volume, you are stuck with what it was last set at.GE makes a universal remote in which you keep pressing a button called \"CODE SEARCH\" until your TV set goes on, then hit ENTER, and all the features of the remote then work with that TV set.  However, bringing a regular sized universal remote everywhere you go is not much fun, so this \"car alarm remote\" disguised universal ON/OFF TV remote is a nice thing to have on your keyring.NOTE:  If you are using this in department stores with security cameras, remember that video cameras can SEE the infrared light that these remotes use, that your naked eye can not.(Point your TV remote at your own camcoder or digital camera, and you will SEE it light up like a flashlight through the video screen.  By the way, this is a great way to test to make sure if a TV remote is working or broken.  If you see the flashes of light with your camera, then the remote is fine, your TV has the problem, or something is blocking or standing in front of the sensor on your TV)So if you have this aimed in the direction of a security camera in the store, it could be detected by store security.  Then again, you are not doing anything illegal, the worst they can do is ask you to leave the store if you are caught having fun with this device.-----------------------------UPDATE -  Battery Replacement-----------------------------After using this device for several months, I noticed that it would not turn off all sets anymore.  Mystery solved, the batteries were just getting low.THIS PART IS IMPORTANT....  When you unscrew and open the device, you see ONE 3V battery.  People might replace this battery, find that the unit still does not work and think the unit is defective.  There are TWO MORE 3V batteries on the OTHER SIDE OF THE PC BOARD!  Those power the LED and need to be replaced too.The first side with just the ONE 3 volt battery was a thin 2016 battery and I happened to have a 2032 which is double the thickness and fit perfectly in the battery slot.  Turns out the website for this device even says to PUT a 2032 in the unit, even though it came from the factory with the 2016 in it.Both are 3 volt batteries, but the thicker one will last longer, just as a AA battery will have more power than a AAA battery, even though both are 1.5 volts.On the other side, you can't use the 2032's since you need to fit TWO 3 volt batteries in the slot (to get 6 volts) and two 2016's will fit, but only one 2032 would fit in the same space.So, you will need to get (1) 2032 battery and (2) 2016 batteries when it comes time to replace them.  They are available at Radio Shack and I even found them at the grocery store with the other batteries, so they are not hard to find.With new fresh batteries, the unit is again working as before.While the batteries were weak, it would have enough power to turn off the first sets in the string of codes, but then the LED would go dim and not turn off any other sets.  So if after months of use, you find it turns off some sets and not as many others as it used to, time to replace the batteries.I use this thing a lot, so the batteries lasted as long as they can be expected to, considering the small size of the batteries.I have been thinking of taking it apart and putting into a hat with bigger battery pack and 4 infrared LEDs around the hat so that it turns all sets off no matter what way I am facing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "GREAT FUN!!", "unixReviewTime": 1107561600, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2005"}

It looks like an expensive shoulder-mount camera, but I suspect much of what is inside is air. It is really a smaller camera in a larger case with a few extras.The biggest downside is the lack of audio input control. There is a single, stereo mini-plug for the mike input. It does come with a mini-plug shotgun mike that works pretty well. However, even with a Beachtek XLR adapter with volume controls, you really don't have manual control. If the scene starts quiet, the initial fraction of a second of louder sound can become distorted.The LCD is a little small, but you also have the eyepiece viewfinder. While the camera offers manual white balance and exposure, there are no zebra stripes to guide you. You can set the lens ring to control exposure or focus, but not both at once. It needs a lot of light for proper colors, focus and contrast. The cam has a low-light function, but I think it reduces the frame rate to 15 fps.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good pix from this shoulder-mount cam, but limitations", "unixReviewTime": 1383955200, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2013"}

I know that some lights take AAA's and that would be a little bit less but it still adds up over time, in that respect this cover will pay for itself over time and that is what I was looking for. The cover itself is a little plain but that might do for most. I would think that a little more attention to detail and better cover material would have been in line for the price of this cover, Amazon could spice it up a notch and make it look like an expensive hardbound book but that is just my opinion. The only other con that I think is the worst in my book is that Amazon forgot to design a closure to keep the cover closed when not in use, a simple magnet under one side of the cover would have sufficed or even the dreaded strap would have been better than nothing at all. I gave this a four star rating overall for the few shortcomings but I am still happy with my purchase over the other options out there simply because the light does not take replacing batteries, hope this helps a few on the fence.Update- In my first review I gave this cover 4 stars but I am adding on to give it a full 5 stars. I have noticed that I use my Kindle at night 85% of the time and I am saving more money by not having to buy batteries than I originally conceived.

Second, what I don't know about acoustics would fill multiple volumes of encyclopedias.  I tell you this up front so you'll know the perspective this review is written from.We ordered these speakers after listening to them at a major electronics retailer I don't think Amazon will let me mention by name.  Delivery was super quick.  Be aware that these are large and heavy by bookshelf speaker standards.  Setup was a breeze; I'm using an older JVC CD player/receiver we've had stored for years.The first music I played on them was a duet Jazz CD from Boney James and Rick Braun.  I was just a tad disappointed.  Don't get me wrong: sound was full and quite crisp, but the stories about Bose products being heavy on the bass are definitely true.The second CD was a greatest hits collection by BB King.  This time the speakers KICKED A**.  The sound was powerful yet absolutely pure.Next came a classical CD.  I listened to a piece by Bach.  Believe it or not, I think the speakers played it better than the other forms of music!  My ignorant layman's guess is that, since classical has almost none of that \"bass\" sound common to Rock, the speakers couldn't emphasize that aspect of the music over the others.In any event, the piece was delightfully reproduced in the small room, the individual instruments both making themselves known while also blending together very nicely.Right now I am listening to \"Peace of Mind\" by Boston and, with its strong bass beat and electric sound it's like being at a live concert.  This is how Rock should sound!A word here about volume: if you plan to put your speakers in a small room you might want to check out the more compact, not to mention cheaper, 201s instead.  These 301s are rocking the house right now even though the volume isn't set very high. Sound is clean and distortion-free, however.\"Do Ya\" by Electric Light Orchestra just started.  Very nice!Bottom line: I recommend these speakers for good all around use.  I put in a Jazz classics CD a little while ago and it sounded fine, the sound was very \"full,\" and that's the only word I can think of to describe it, but I liked it and that's all that matters.I think I understand why Bose products are so polarizing: these are speakers for \"the people,\" not audiophile snobs. They are designed to excel with the most popular forms of music.  So, if you like Rock, hip-hop, even Blues - or, weirdly enough, classical! - then you will probably like them.If your taste runs more towards, say, flute musicians from the Andes, you may want to look at Tivoli or Boston Acoustics instead.  Overall, however, I am quite pleased and would give these speakers a glowing recommendation.\"High on You\" by Survivor just kicked in.  Man, that song brings back some memories...UPDATE ON THIS REVIEW: I originally had these speakers resting on a fireplace mantle about five feet high, well above my head when I am sitting in my recliner.  I recently moved them to stands that are about 30 inches high and pointed them  directly at the chair I sit in.  The result is greatly improved sound quality with ALL forms of music - just thought I should toss that in.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for some forms of music, good for others", "unixReviewTime": 1196899200, "reviewTime": "12 6, 2007"}

Compared to the Zoom, this unit starts faster, is easier to use and has better sensitivity.The automatic recording level control is usable, and it's a good thing to have in cases where you can't pay attention to the recorder (e.g. if you're recording yourself live). Otherwise, manual level will probably get you better results. Switching between manual and auto level is easy, and the manual level control is easy to manipulate. A green led lights up when your input is at -12dB and a red led lights up when you reach 0dB. Your goal is to keep the green light on and the red light off. :-)Another useful feature is the ability to switch the output from headphone to line-out level. Line-out will drive an external amplifier much better than headphone level. It would be nice to have 2 separated dedicated outputs, but of course it's a compromise between size and usability, and the change is only about half a dozen keystrokes away when you need it.Connection to a Windows 7 PC via USB cable was straightforward and didn't require drivers. The unit's internal memory and the memory card (if you have one) show up as separate \"disks\" in Windows Explorer. Moving files between the unit and the PC is straightforward, although the folder structure in the unit is unnecessarily complex.The unit comes with 4GB of internal memory, which is enough for about 6 hours worth of CD-quality recording, i.e., more than enough. But if you decide to use a memory card, do what the manual says, and format the card in the recorder (not in your computer). I'm using a SanDisk 8GB micro-SDHC, and the card started performing much better (the M10 was able to boot much faster) after I re-formatted the card in the unit. I would have preferred a standard SD, since the micro SD card is so tiny and easy to misplace, but thumbs up to Sony for supporting a standard, and not only their own brand of memory sticks. The manual lists the makes of cards that have been tested: Toshiba, Panasonic and SanDisk, up to 16GB. Be sure to read the manual about positioning/orienting the memory card.

When I needed the warranty I went on the web and found out that Tom Tom America was just in between switching their warranty policies to make them more local. Go 710 (or a unit bough before certain date early in 2007) still carries 2 years warranty. Starting with Go 720 you are cut short.

It was still giving directions but the screen went blank. You tapped the screen and the picture vent on. Then after some 15 seconds it started dying again. You tapped it. Again. Again. It was an intermittent issue. Some days it still worked fine and then it turned bad again. I missed my chance to have it serviced back then as I was relying on the ...bullet proof 2 years warranty.

And unfortunately, the Zi8 automatically powers off after about 30 seconds of inactivity.  I've not yet found a way around this.  The only possibility I can think of is using a power adapter with the Zi8, which may prevent it from powering down.  This is more of a weakness in the camera, though.  The Zi8 ought to allow you to change the time delay for the auto power-off feature, or disable it.  Another big negative is that the remote simply allows you to cycle through the camera settings (1080, 720 60fps, 720, etc.).  If the camera is facing you, you have no idea where you are in the settings cycle.  If are behind the camera, you can see OK, but only from a limited distance.  If this were designed exclusively for a particular camera model, perhaps they could have provided buttons to precisely control the settings.All that said, the remote works and seems to be reliable.

Initially all I received was the SD card adapter in the mail, no 8GB microSDHC card, no plastic storage case. After a few days of email back and forth with customer support, they did ship out the 8GB microSDHC card, but still no plastic storage case as pictured. I really felt like I was being shipped out used product, but can't prove it. I'll buy locally next time, or from some other merchant. If they advertise it as new product, I would think it should come in retail packaging. This was not the case.Given the issue with having to reformat the card, and feeling like I probably got a used product, I downgraded this purchased from 5 stars to 3 stars.2/22/13 Update: I continue to have SD Card Read errors with this card. It's the only card I have problems with in my devices. I cannot help but to think that I was shipped a returned/defective card, especially considering it never came in retail packaging.

Wind", "helpful": [2, 6], "reviewText": "The VuScape is a product that I want to love, but because of a few significant flaws I have to say it's not the perfect iPad 2 case.First, the positive:  This case is slim and lightweight, but relatively sturdy. The material looks and feels good, and it seems to provide some protection for your iPad 2 when the case is closed. The soft material inside is easy on the iPad's screen.I also like that it has really well-defined grooves for using it as a stand. This works perfectly in landscape view, although it does not provide any significant support in portrait view. The iPad rests securely when in the landscape view configuration.Finally, unlike some other cases in this category, this case doesn't suffer from having a bad smell, which is always a good thing!As I said, however, there are some flaws.The iPad 2 is held in place by rigid, curved-up corners. These seem to be somewhat stiff and sturdy, but even when new, the lower right corner of mine would not \"lock\" onto the corner of the iPad, leaving it to flop free. Granted, the central \"lip\" held the iPad tightly in the case, but I could see that this method of securing the iPad would become unreliable in the future. On top of that, because the fit is so reliant on the iPad's original dimensions, it seems like you might experience problems if you have a protective skin (Zagg, BSE, etc.) on your iPad. I can't confirm this, as I don't use such a skin (That's what the case is for!) but I would be wary about squeezing this into those tight clamping corners/lips with an extra  millimeter of material on the iPad 2.Another thing I consider a flaw is the fact that the entire front bezel is unprotected. Some people may prefer this so they can \"show off the beauty of the iPad\", but for me, I'd rather have my expensive gadget protected from being cracked if the glass bezel happens to take a small whack. Most cases cover the bezel, giving it an extra layer of protection; This one does not. For the money, I'd rather know my iPad is safe, even if it's not as pretty.I dislike that to use the grooves and utilize this as a stand, you essentially have to snap the iPad out of two of the corners that secure it. This means you're constantly snapping it in and out, weakening the corners of the case and putting stress on the iPad itself. This isn't acceptable in my book.My final verdict is that this is an attractive, sturdy case that is excellent for those who are more concerned about the cosmetic appearance of their iPad when it's in a case, and because of that, it sacrifices security and protective features in favor of aesthetics. It isn't a bad case, by any means. If you're the type who wants a case that shows off your iPad, this is probably your best choice next to Apple's own Smart Cover. At least this protects the aluminum back of the iPad, unlike Apple's offering.However, if you want something to protect the front bezel and secure the iPad if you drop it, this is a mediocre choice. It won't protect those corners or edges in a short drop, and it certainly seems like all the popping in and out of the two inner corners for landscape display would eventually weaken the corners and cause your iPad to have an increasingly lower chance of staying securely in this case. If you seek serious protection instead of aesthetic beauty, consider other choices.So while Targus makes a case here that is pleasing to the eye (and nose), I have to dock it two stars for its lack of protective features and security where the front bezel is concerned. Targus can, and does, do better than this.UPDATE: I've been using this for a while, and I have grown to like it a bit more. I've upped the rating by one star because it has been very sturdy, despite the weight, and it works for my needs. I wish it were a bit more stable in portrait view, and I'm still not entirely pleased with the \"snap in\" design, but it does provide some decent protection.On top of that, I'm kind of fond of it because I can customize it a bit. The hole where the Apple logo shows looks much better with a photo or something else there, and it displays it for the world to see when you're using your iPad. Pretty cool.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Quality case with a few flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1301356800, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2011"}

Because of the requirements for HDMI/DHCP I can't hook a PS3 directly up to an iMac without another device such as the Kanex XD.Compared to the 27\" iMac's screen this screen is awful.  For one the viewing angles are atrocious (there is no way to adjust for this because this is how all non-IPS displays are).  I knew about the limitations of non-IPS displays before this purchase and thought it would not be this bad but it is.  Sitting level with the center of the screen there is drastic tonal color shift from the top of the display to the bottom.  On OS X where you may have a window with tables of alternating white/blue rows, the rows fade from blue at the top to near white at the bottom.Because of the terrible viewing angles it is impossible to calibrate the monitor unless you are able to always use the monitor with your head positioned in the exact same position every time you use it.  Shifting your head left, right, up or down even a few inches alters the colors.You would think that a monitor where viewing angles are critical the stand would be highly adjustable.  But the only possible adjustment is a slight tilt forward or backwards.  The bottom of the LCD screen is only 4\" from the desktop it sits on so most peoples' eyes will already be centered at the top of the monitor which automatically means you are going to have severe tonal shift.The only acceptable use for this monitor would be for watching movies (you will still need speakers since this monitor has none) or playing console games from at least 4 feet away from the screen where you may not as easily notice the flaws even though they will still be affecting the picture.  As a computer monitor though you are forewarned.I think most people rate monitors such as this one highly because they have not used IPS displays in the past and compared to other TN displays it may have a decent screen (or are viewing the display from at least 4 feet away).  It is unfortunate that IPS displays are considerably more expensive and I thought I could save myself money by getting a second monitor such as this one but I will be returning it to Amazon.If someone has a recommendation for a LED IPS display with HDMI and DVI &lt; 30\"  I would be interested.[Updated August 9, 2010]It appears Apple's new 27\" LED Cinema Display may be the answer.  Its tech specs state that one of the resolutions it supports is 1920x1080 which should allow the Kanex XD to output full 1080p to that monitor from a Blu-Ray player/PS3.  Its one of the very few IPS LED displays to be available on the market.  That display is 3 times the cost of this monitor but at least I know that screen will not have any viewing angle problems sitting 2.5 feet in front of me.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Compared to 27\" iMac screen", "unixReviewTime": 1281225600, "reviewTime": "08 8, 2010"}

I've built the home-made versions that claim to outperform professionally designed HDTV antennas (but don't), and I've tried Terk and Phillips models.  So far, this inexpensive RCA antenna surpassed all those for signal strength and mostly glitch-free reception.  (Tests are limited to livingroom-capable models thus far.  When I find a better antenna - rabbit ears style or attic mount - I'll buy it.)Con:Occasional dropouts, particularly during windy weather (tree movement must affect reception).  But most of the time I'm getting great reception from 15 local HDTV channels here in Minneapolis.* * * *UPDATE:* * * *Rabbit ears really do the job if transmission towers are just a few miles away - yet they frequently require adjustment and are vulnerable to weather-related signal loss, particularly on windy days (nearby tree movement must be a factor).  Since writing this review I ordered two more antennas on Amazon:Antennas Direct DB2 Multi Directional HDTV Antennahttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHUE7I.... I used for about half a year, same location as the RCA rabbit ears, mounted on a tripod.  Subjectively, a modest improvement for acquiring and holding signal, yet signal would drift and was difficult to focus.  Too often it would not hold signal - and I would come home to find a few unwatchable recordings due to numerous signal disruptions.  In fairness:  I was not using it as directed, for the DB2 is marketed as an attic or roof antenna, not as a replacement for a TV-mount antenna.RCA ANT751R Outdoor Antenna Optimized for Digital Receptionhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024R4B5C.... This model dramatically outperformed DB2, not just in my livingroom setting; remarkably, I stress tested it for a few days by placing it in the basement, and it still outperformed the DB2 (which was on the main floor).  ANT751R is too big and klunky for the livingroom, but after these tests I knew I had my choice:  this is the antenna I would mount into the attic with an RG6 coaxial cable and electrical ground (recommended protection).  Result:  my signal tester (Tivo) finally rates all local channels in the 90% or higher signal strength (most are about 94%, 98%, or 100%).  Dropouts still occur, but they are remarkably rare and short-lived, even during adverse weather - a dramatic improvement.My ideal solution may be a roof-mounted antenna, possibly a different model, but for now I'm pretty thrilled.As always:  what works for one antenna user, is not what will work FOR YOU.  Get to know your own local conditions.  Use the TV Fool website or similar resources, look up your own address, discover the transmission tower locations and which antenna types are recommended for your use.

This is a nice feature because when using a long (and possibly heavy) lens with the mount and a tripod, having the ability to mount the tripod shoe directly to the mount adapter takes the pressure off of the built in camera mount and puts it onto the mount adapter. This is beneficial for obvious reasons as the mount adapter breaking, due to the weight of a lens, is much cheaper to replace than is the actual camera mount. But of course the Canon mount is probably made much more sturdy, and if there is a chance that this cheaper adapter could drop the lens it is probably better to trust the strength of the canon mount.

It flat out rocks. Let me just get a few things straight regarding this lens vs. the newer 24-70mm lens that replaced it:1. This lens is more stout than the 24-70mm, yes, but it is also noticeably shorter which to me is preferable. This means it has a nearer/lower center of gravity and is easier to manage for long periods of time. The 24-70mm is basically like handling a telephoto zoom (i.e. 70-200mm or 80-200mm) with its center of gravity further out, harder to handle for long periods and easier to knock into people with.2. The 24-70mm is a very sharp lens. I understand that. This lens is at least as sharp, however, and in my opinion slightly sharper. This becomes important in point number 3 below.3. This lens can be picked up for roughly 2/3 the price of the 24-70mm. To me that settles the issue. Now, if the 24-70mm had VR then maybe it would be a different story but it doesn't. Again the 24-70mm is harder to handle, longer, no sharper and costs at least 50% more ($1,000-ish vs $1,5000-ish)I hope I have made a good case for getting one of these over the newer 24-70. This is a top notch solid professional battle ready piece of equipment here. Don't listen to the talk of it being \"too big\" or \"too heavy.\" First of all, as I said it's much easier to maneuver than the longer 24-70, and second of all the heaviness of this lens is overrated. If you are coming from a kit lens yes you will find it heavy. If you are used to shooting with pro glass this will not seem extraordinary heavy. It is in line with professional Canon and Nikon glass I have used over the years in terms of weight.

It took no more than 10 minutes following the excellent instructions placed here by an Amazon poster: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NMQ2X44EXIPH/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R2NMQ2X44EXIPH.The new pads seem to be well constructed. Compared to \"before\", they've increased the clamping a bit, being a bit thicker than the originals, and are comfortable.In my estimation, the leakage out is minimal, if at all, at anything less than levels that will damage hearing; and the isolation from external sounds is very good (in both cases, about the same, or perhaps slightly better than, the OEM earpads on my new, 2014 MDR-V6 cans).However, the impact on the signature of the MDR-V6 is significant in  the low bass! Depending on your point of view, that could be good, or it could be bad. Read on and judge for yourself:Comparing the vintage MDR-V6 headphones \"before\" and \"after\" replacing the earpads:Driven by the headphone circuit of my Harmon/Kardon 80 watt RMS integrated amplifier, the Beyer earpads have altered the frequency response - there's more bass below 100 Hz (guessing about +6dB higher than before centered around 60/70Hz) and slightly less very high end (guessing about -2dB lower at 10kHz than before, barely noticeable unless you listen for it). The \"before\" was about +3dB between about 50Hz and 150Hz (studio quality), meaning the \"after\" is about +9dB between 50Hz and 150Hz (not studio quality).Comparing the vintage MDR-V6/Beyer combo to new 2014 MDR-V6 headphones:Driven by the headphone circuit of my Harmon/Kardon 80 watt RMS integrated amplifier, compared to a brand new pair of V6 cans (2014 copyright on box, and \"Made in Thailand\") that I use for traveling, the additional boost below 100Hz is also there, giving more punch to my vintage V6/Beyer combination  over my new 2014 V6 cans. The difference is noticeable between my vintage V6/Beyer earpads combo and the new 2014 V6. The V6/Beyer combo is about +4dB higher between 50Hz and 150Hz). (Side comment: The 2014 V6's signature is about +5dB between 50Hz and 150Hz - a bit higher than the vintage V6's +3db between 50Hz and 150Hz signature when new).Comparing the vintage MDR-V6/Beyer combo to AKG Austrian built K701 headphones:Driven by the headphone circuit of my Harmon/Kardon 80 watt RMS integrated amplifier, compared to my studio reference AKG Austrian built K701 headphones, the V6/Beyer low end boost and punch is extremely obvious (+9dB 50z-150Hz - not studio quality at all) to the point of blurring low end clarity at times. This leads me to NOT RECOMMEND THE V6 WITH BEYER EARPADS FOR STUDIO WORK (monitoring/mixing/mastering). If you're doing studio work, stick with Sony's OEM replacement earpads for your MDR-V6 cans.Here's some good news: The MDR-V6/Beyer earpads combo sounds just about right on my Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone for most musical genres  with \"SoundAlive\" set to \"Classical\". The resulting headphone/earpad signature comes pretty close to an AKG K701.

HMMMM.  Decided to try charging IMP1000 overnight, plugged into ipad next morning and in no time it fully charged.  I guess it is safe to say that the the IMP needs a full charge to be effective, like any other electronic product the battery will lose it's charge over time and dont always trust the blue light level.  Anyway works fine now.Update 11/1/13 (20 months later) My family has been using the IMP1000 daily since March 2012 it has traveled across the continental US, to London, and soon to Japan.  I am not sure how many times we charged it ( i don't think we hit the 500 mark) but it is in constant everyday use (iPhones, iPads) and there have been absolutely no problems at all.  If you think yours is crapping out just give it a full overnight charge.  I originally paid $79.99 in March 2012.  Price check on Amazon today is $39.95, since my kids refuse to let me use it anymore, it's a no brainer,  I just ordered another one.  I am really surprised that it lasted this long, will keep posting updates until it dies.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Highly recommended buy... as advertised and reviewed", "unixReviewTime": 1331424000, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2012"}

There are plenty of features one probably will never use, at the expense of basic features that I need.1.  The Manual is horrible.2.  The onscreen Menu is worse.3.  There is no CD source RCA hook-up.  I had to use the \"DOCK\" connection.4.  There is no RCA connection for my turntable.  I have a large 33 rpm collection.  I had to use the SAT/CBL connection.5.  After hooking up the composite video from my DVD/VIDEO player to the Denon receiver and then connecting the HDMI cable from the Denon receiver to the TV, as instructed in the Manual, I could not get any audio from the TV or the DVD/VIDEO player, so I had to use the 3rd and last RCA for connecting audio from the TV to the Denon receiver.6.  I made an optical audio connection from the TV to the Denon receiver, but I could only get sound from the digital channels - no sound from the analog channels.7.  Because of the above problems, I have to access my TV through my DVD/VIDEO player, so I cannot use any of the functions that I would get to use if I could use the TV as a source.  The problem with the DVD/VIDEO channel selector is that I cannot get the \"decimal\" digital channels (like 6.1) with the DVD/VIDEO channel select.  So I have to set the Denon remote on the DVD setting for sound and then use the TV remote to change channels.  That also means means that I have to remember to set the TV to Channel 3 to watch a DVD or Video.8.  Can't say that I am thrilled with the audio quality now that I have bandaided this into a workable system.

It is the best bang for the buck without a doubt. It is not a true surround system, so if you really want true surround you'd better go with a 5.1 or 7.1 system. As far as sound bar goes, I would put up this Sony system against anything out there right now. I listened to the high end sound bars such as Bower Wilkins, Bose SR1 (both costs around $1,500 to $2,500) in the Magnolia section at Best Buy and at the Bose store to make sure they were set up properly. I also listened to some mid end sound bars from Harmon Kardon and Polk (around $600) and some low end systems from Samsung, LG, Vizio, etc...Didn't think the BW and Bose systems sounded any better than Harmon Kardon or Polk, and even if you're a critical audiophile, well the BW and Bose were definitely not $1,500 or $2,500 better. Didn't have a chance to listen to the Sony system before buying it. Just read reviews, compared specs, and took the plunge. Was not too impressed at first just using default settings out of the box, so I re-read some of the reviews on Amazon and read the manual thoroughly, and adjusted the controls (especially output) accordingly. What a difference!!! Now the sound is awesome!!! Like I said, I'd put it up against the BW and Bose systems in a blindfold test. For a small or average room, this Sony is the best bang for the buck out there at $400 MSRP (I purchased mine from Amazon for much less. It was on sale at the time). It will fill your room. The highs are clear and the bass is solid.Very clever mounting system too. No fancy bracket needed for the sound bar. All you need is 2 standard screws or nails on the wall. That's it.For those people who gave it a negative review, my guess is, they probably used the default settings or didn't adjust the controls properly. I agree with some of the reviewers here. Sony should change the default settings and make it sound awesome right out of the box. If you set it up correctly (fairly easy to do), you'll be impressed with this system. Once again, read the manual and/or check some reviews on this site or others for suggested settings.Didn't give it 5 stars because it only has 3 HDMI inputs (wish it had 4) and does not have a center channel (but that's only a very minor issue because even without a center channel, the movie dialogue still sounds very good because you do have the ability to control the dialogue volume too). The Bose system is worse when it comes to movie dialogue.I've owned this system for over 4 months now and am very happy with it. It's the best value out there. You will not be disappointed!!!Update 3/21/12:I forgot to mention (some other reviewers have already mentioned this) you also need to adjust the output of your media sources to get the best sound. After adjusting my Sony system, the sound got a little better, but still not to my satisfaction until I re-read a review on this site and noticed the reviewer mentioned adjusting the output of his source. So, I went to the Menu settings of my LG Blue Ray player and changed its output accordingly to match the Sony system, and voila. Now, the sound coming out of a Blue Ray source is simply out of this world on this Sony system.

The images all seemed to have an over-smoothed, anti-aliased quality coming right off the camera. I tried photographing stationary subjects outdoors, the camera hand-held, in bright early day broad daylight, with Image stablization both activated and then turned off.The results weren't blurry or out of focus. Yet I could tell this camera would apparently never achieve tack sharp focus. The deal-breaker for me was that another very cheap camera that I have at hand -- the Fuji JV100 -- produced sharper/better images of the same photo-op. The Powershot SX170 might well be an adequate camera for the arena of low expectations: for production of icons, thumbnails and small images on the net.

I am strictly commenting on the quality of images it produces.One thing: Where my latest camera before the SX170 has an image default dpi of 72 (with image widths of 55 inches at 12 mp) when I open pics in Photoshop for post-processing, this camera produces images of 180 dpi at smaller dimensions as a starting point. This difference got me to wondering about how much and what kind of interpolation is taking place with my old camera versus this one.Perhaps the interpolating is where things are being bungled by the camera. Or maybe it is the anti-aliasing filter on the image sensor.

At general info sites, this specific information is scant; maybe specialist sites will be able to help.Cannot recommend the Powershot SX170.

My experience with this camera makes me wonder if the same could be true of all newer generation Canon 16 and 18 MP cameras within a hundred dollar range of this one.

The instructions have bad English but are still readable.  It comes with a bunch of bags of screws, washers, etc. and it did have the correct screws for my 40\" Sony Bravia XBR.  However I don't think it has enough variations for all tvs, so I'd be prepared to supply your own.  Get them before hand so you're not stuck there.  The mount mounts onto the wall with 6 large coarse threaded hex bolts, and included are 6 concrete anchors as well.  I was mounting mine into a stud/beam so no need for the anchors.It mounts to the wall very securely and there's absolutely no way it's coming off unless your bolts aren't anchored well.  Luckily my wall has a large horizontal beam running above the fireplace so I had no trouble hitting studs.  I don't recall if the bolt holes are 16\" apart (standard stud placement), but I assume they would be.The vertical brackets you see pictured then screw into the back of your tv with 4 smallish screws, and if anything this would be the weakest point, but this is no fault of the mount.  It just pales in comparison to the bolts that secure it to the wall.  Once the vertical bars are mounted to the tv you (and hopefully a friend) just lift it onto the mount and the vertical bars hook onto the horizontal mount rails.  You can tilt it from 0-10 degrees and a small hand crank on each side secures it in place.Make sure to attach your cables BEFORE you mount it on the wall, 'cause once it's up there you have very little clearance behind it, and the vertical bars block access from the sides.  I learned this the hard way after I lifted my 40\" 80 lb. LCD by myself onto the mount and then realized I couldn't gain access to the back to plug in the cables.Finally there are a set of phillips head screws that you screw in from the bottom to keep the hooks from coming back up and off the horizontal rails.  Of course the weight of the tv keeps this from happening, but you can imagine during an earthquake or something the screws would prevent that.  The screws were a little difficult to access once the tv was mounted, but I was able to get in there and cinch them down.Overall I'd say this mount is of good quality and while it doesn't include the bubble level it claims to (you should have your own anyway if you are mounting a tv), it's an exceptional value compared to all the others I've seen.  I almost went with a $70'ish dollar more well known mount, but thought I'd give this a try.

This is a great lens for spontaneous family pictures.  With the kit zoom lens, it takes a couple of seconds to zoom your picture and a little more for the camera to focus.  With this prime lens, you simply press the shutter and it takes the picture virtually instantly.  With the f 2.8 lens I was able to take pictures in a well lit interior without flash using a continuous setting.  The quality of pictures are great and the background is slightly fuzzy which is what I want so the focus is on the subject. With the kit zoom lens, a small fraction of pictures don't come out due to exposure, focus, or framing is too tight.

I shoot mostly outdoor landscapes, nature and events.  The 10.5 Fisheye lens is fantastic, sharp, and gives you a perspective unlike any lens you have.  I shoot with my 12-24 and 18-200 but now put on the 10.5 if I really want to see a great perspective.  Get in close.  It focuses to about 6 inches so move in close and change your angle for best composition.It is really well suited for a beautiful sunset with far reaching clouds.  The secret is to use Nikon Capture NX as post processing to automatically correct the fisheye to make it look like a super-duper wide angle.  Then load the file into Photoshop or whatever you use.  Depending upon the subject, and your position you don't always have to correct the fisheye because it makes very interesting shots.  For example, I won't correct the perspective in Capture NX when I shoot a close up of a flower because it looks great without it.If you like to spend time composing a shot and try to get it right in the camera, then you will REALLY like this lens.  If you usually just walk around with a \"normal\" lens on your camera and take snap shots, this isn't your lens.The lens comes with a deep lens cap.  There are no threads for filters or a screw-on cap.  The lens cap just slides on and stays on.The size of the lens is very similar to the 50mm f1.8 lens, so it is small enough to put in your pocket and keep it with you when you need it.  You will find yourself looking at things differently when you have this lens.  For example, I take my camera on my hikes (which I logged over 1000 GPS miles in 2007) and now find many more things to shoot that needs a perspective wider than my beloved 12-24 zoom provides.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Impressive Lens...use Capture NX for postprocessing", "unixReviewTime": 1199404800, "reviewTime": "01 4, 2008"}

Did I mention I had stabilization on when testing the battery?* Awesome screen! It's big, clear and sharp.* 1080p? This is not the feature I bought it for--oddly enough--but in my tests it worked perfectly. Perhaps useful for videos that max out the digital zoom.* Uploads quickly to the computer.

The only way to watch your 1080p video IMHO.Over all, a nice upgrade/addition to the Kodak pocket video camera line. The price Amazon had it at was way too good to resist.

I purchase the previous Capture View compact from Mead for $$$$....I was so disappointed because its picture quality was little better than a toy. It could not handle low light and the resolution was that of a Barbie Camera (Mattel)!  Still I fell in love with the concept of a marriage between the digital camera and the Binocular. I felt that I was taking a real chance here on buying this product, but I figured that with 2MP (Which ...by the way there is a setting for 3MP) it had to be better hten the first CaptureView. I was right (Thank God!) This Digital Binocular really works and with acceptable quality.I also have a Coolpix 4500, so I figured I would compare how the coolpix 4500 at full digital zoom and the Meade binoculars compared. I focused on a subject of a construction site far on the horizon (Must be a few miles away). As far as Magnification, both the CoolPix 4500 and the Binoculars are about tied. ( So maybe a camera is more versitile in most cases.) But the coolpix pictures at full digital zoom could not stand up to the clarity of the Binoculars picture.The Binoculars arrived with some smudges on the plastic body casing (Looks like grease, which I had to clean off), There was also a minor scratch on the plastic, but still not worth sending back and complaining since this is not a gift and all I care about is functionality. The body is kind of cheap in appearance but this one has a lot more functionality than the other binocular combos I have seen. One comment though....WHERE ARE THE LENS CAPS??? Geez, you make a quality lens for a binocular and don't include a $ .. lens cap for it....it just does not make sense.I am satisfied with this product, although I believe that the Digital Binocular is still in its young days, and will improve greatly in the next few years.I think ypur option to buy this product depends on what you wish to do with it....For taking pictures of objects within a 300ft range, stick with your camera.  To get fair to good quality shots at a great distance, this is the ticket. I have not tried making a 90 second AVI movie yet...I'll do that when the weather clears, but I have tried shooting in low light.  Since there is no shuttle control, you will not be able to do any astrophotography with this unit ( a bright moon appears washed out...) but it can do low light situations. I could not hold it steady enough to do Mars, although it did show up looking quiet like a bright star in the pic ( Just with a trail since my hand is unsteady..) HINT: The next version needs a tripod mounting screw....In summary this is a little expensive at $$$$ I think I would like to pay about $$$$ for it. I also feel that the casing could be stronger and a camera is more versitle (Third-party vendors make a zoom lens for the coolpix...I could have gone for that...but I love new technologies so I gave this a try.)I give this Capture View Binoculars four stars because it meets my expectations of what it should be able to do.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Head and Sholders better than CaptureView  compact 640x480", "unixReviewTime": 1060992000, "reviewTime": "08 16, 2003"}

{"reviewerID": "A2W73JAQ4AVCNJ", "asin": "B0074WDDN8", "reviewerName": "Jim Hart", "helpful": [25, 26], "reviewText": "First impressions:(This is not intended as a comprehensive review of the O-MD.  It is, rather, a compilation of random thoughts and impressions gathered during my first 24 hours with the O-MD.  Full reviews are, of course, available elsewhere along with sample photographs and reviews of the \"kit\" lens.  The intention of this review is to perhaps answer a question or two that a perspective buyer might have.)The camera is heavier than one might think, especially with the 12-50mm weather sealed lens attached.As noted in other reviews the camera is smaller than it appears in many photographs. If one has large hands one might consider finding a brick and mortar store in order to test the ergonomics of the O-MD.  I have medium sized hands; my DSLR is a Nikon D300 with battery grip attached.  That is a fairly large (and heavy) system, but I have found no problem in adjusting to the much smaller O-MD body.  I am, however, considering the purchase of the optional grip for the O-MD to counterbalance the weight of some lenses.***EDIT: I ordered the HLD-6; Amazon has them discounted to $325 as of this writing, some $70 under suggested retail  6/23/12.  I would recommend that anyone considering the OM-D E5 camera also consider the battery grip (available on Amazon, there are reviews of the grip available).  I now consider it a \"must have\" if one does considerable portrait style framing or if one wants the security of having two batteries available.  Note that the spare battery does not come with the grip!  The grip does add some bulk and weight to the system, but not as much as I had feared.  The battery in the grip may be accessed if the camera is mounted on a tripod or monopod.***I do not consider the camera to be \"pocketable\"; even with the Panasonic 20mm \"pancake\" lens attached it would require a rather large pocket to hold the camera.The rubber thumb grip on the right/rear of the body feels very secure and offers a good grip for my hands.  Those with larger hands may not find this to be the case.The 12-50mm weather sealed lens (heaviest of the \"kit\" lenses) begs for support from the left hand when shooting.  The length and weight of the lens overbalances the camera body, causing the camera to want to tilt downwards.  (This, of course, would be the case on any interchangeable lens camera body to which a long, heavy lens was attached).The two control dials fall \"readily too hand\"; the rear dial is within easy reach of my forefinger, thus negating the need to move my right thumb from the rear grip.The \"on/off\" switch is in, possibly, not the best location.  It is the lower right corner of the camera body.  I prefer a switch over the \"on/off\" button on the Olympus E-PL1, but having it mounted on the top of the camera, like the Nikon D300, would be ideal.  However there is not much real estate available on a camera as small as this, so one has to make some concessions as to control placement.  The reason the current location is poor is not because it may be accidentally powered off or on, it's poor because having it on the top of the camera makes it more ergonomic.  Your index finger or thumb are already in place when picking up the camera to reach a top mounted switch, whereas the current location of the switch requires that the camera be supported by the left hand while the right hand powers the body up.The shutter button is smooth to operate.The control buttons on the back, being weather sealed, are not as \"crisp\" in movement as one might be accustomed to in other camera bodies.  I do not find that an issue, but I am used to working with weather sealed cameras; others may have a small period of acclimation before the buttons feel \"right\".The tilting screen can be completely turned off while shooting through the electronic viewfinder (EVF), or can be programmed to turn off automatically when the EVF is used.  I prefer the EVF full time, and so have powered down the screen except for reviewing photographs or changing menus.  The tilt screen is functional, but I cannot give more information on that feature because it is simply one I will not use.  Other reviewers have posted comments on the usability of the tilt screen, and I would recommend that those who are interested in the feature read those reviews.There is a slight delay in powering up the EVF when brought to one's eye, even when the tilting screen is powered down.  This is different from the Olympus VF2 EVF (which may be used on several of the Olympus Pen camera bodies).  The VF2 can be set to being continuously on, while the O-MD EVF goes dark when removed from the eye.  The delay is not long enough to cause the missing of a shot, but is at first disconcerting for those (like me) who are not expecting it.The \"instant review\" of photographs can be turned off, which is my preferred method of shooting.  Even having the just-taken shot come up automatically for .3 seconds can be distracting.  However if one does want to review the just-taken shot the time the review is visible is adjustable in the menu.The EVF itself is very good (caveat being that I have limited experience with this camera at this point and have not attempted to photograph sports or other rapidly moving subjects).  When rapidly panning the camera there is just a touch of blur in the EVF image.  The EVF is bright and the exposure information seen on the EVF can be modified, and there are several choices of \"grid\" pattern should one choose to see a grid when composing a photograph.There is a sound coming from the in body stabilization mechanism, but it is discernible (to me) only in a nearly silent room.The factory neck strap is lamentable (as are most factory straps); one might budget for a more comfortable strap, such as the OpTech strap.  Of course with a camera this small a wrist strap is also an option.I would recommend the fastest (not the largest) memory card one can afford.  This camera body, while not necessarily in the same class of performance as some of the full framed offerings from Nikon and Canon, still requires a fast card to obtain the maximum satisfaction out of the camera.The fit and finish on the camera that I received is excellent.  The camera, according to a small plate on the bottom, was \"designed in Tokyo and made in China\".I cannot address the video capabilities of the O-MD; I am a photographer, not a cinematographer, and the skills required to create videos will forever elude me.Given that I've had the camera for less than 24 hours and have made only a few test shots with it I cannot make final comment on the quality of the images that the camera can produce.  There are many other reviews available on the Internet written by more experienced (and more skilled) O-MD photographers that include sample images if one cares to do more research. However I do have more than 40 years experience with the 35mm format (on a hobbyist level) and can say that so far I have been favorably impressed by the few photos I've made.  The stabilization technology is first rate and the sensor is, for it's size, excellent.EDIT 6/29/12: The stabilization results from this camera are very, very good.  The In Body Image Stabilization (IBIS) works as advertised and the view through the viewfinder can be set to show the action of the IBIS.  One can actually see the camera shake dwindle and stop as the shutter button is pressed halfway to lock focusing.This camera is not inexpensive and one cannot anticipate that, long term, the camera will retain it's monetary value.  Digital camera bodies tend to depreciate rather quickly compared to, for instance, the Nikon F series of 35mm camera bodies from years past.  Of course one generally buys into a \"system\" rather than a camera body; one purchases external flash units or lenses or grips or other accessories that run the cost of the original purchase up.  Those who are considering purchasing an O-MD as their first \"real\" camera might want to keep such considerations in mind.Cameras must be, as all things are, judged within the framework of their competition. For those considering the O-MD I would recommend considering the Panasonic GH2, the FujiFilm X Pro 1, the FujiFilm X100, the Olympus E-P3, the Sony NEX 5, or the Sony NEX 7.  Those models are, of course, subject to change even as the next round from Olympus will certainly see new technology in the O-MD line.I did a fair amount of research before buying into the O-MD system (to the point of purchasing an Olympus E-PL1 and three lenses in order to see if the Micro Four Third system would be a good fit for my style of photography).  The E-PL1 is a capable camera and is, since it is no longer in production, available new at very reasonable prices. Any lens purchased for the E-PL1 will, of course, work on the O-MD as well.  (Currently the E-PL1 is under three hundred dollars, including the kit lens: http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-E-PL1-Interchangeable-Digital-Black/dp/B0035LBRJO/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1340468881&sr;=1-1&keywords;=olympus+e-pl1 ).Having tested the water with the E-PL1 I've decided to work with the O-MD system.  I think that the O-MD is worth learning (one learns a camera as one does a musical instrument, until finding the correct \"keys\" is second nature, requiring no conscious thought).I would not advise potential O-MD buyers to purchase without checking out the other cameras in the genre.  Patience and research may save one from becoming involved in a system that does not ultimately meet ones needs.I have given the Olympus O-MD five stars, even with my short period of familiarization with the camera, as I consider it to be the current class leader in the Micro Four Thirds realm.  It isn't perfect, but it is very, very good.  Of course Panasonic et.al. will certainly respond with their updated flagship offerings; it is a never ending cycle.Recommended.Regards,Jim", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "First impressions", "unixReviewTime": 1340409600, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2012"}

Installed everything fine, did quick power/system checks before actually installing the OS etc and the cooler seemed to work fine while the case was on it's side (Corsair 800D). Once everything was up and running, the pump started to make a very loud grinding noise and could be heard over 4 120mm fans (case + radiator) and 1x 140mm exhaust fan. Searched the web for answers and found that tapping the plastic tubing or the fan controller/pump block would occasionally stop the problem. I requested an exchange with Amazon, new unit arrived in 3-4 days; removed the previously installed H100, cleaned up my cpu and installed the new one. Powered up my system and sure enough, out of the box, this H100 unit was defective as well. The grinding noise in the new unit was even worse. I could not stand the noise coming out of that pump, I was ready to purchase a normal Air cpu heatsink or another Liquid cooler from Intel or Antec.At my local Fry's, I decided on a Antec 920 Khuler with a much smaller radiator + x2 120mm fans and could not be happier...so much more quiet, rubber tubing, slick look and customizable LED on the unit + software for fan control. While browsing for a new replacement, I noticed about 6-8 H100 and other Hydro series liquid coolers with return stickers on them probably with the same pump problem.Save yourself the headache and money, stay away from this unit.Also - on the installation for H100, I noticed the the screws provided are too long and bend the radiator fins when installing your fans.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Defective out of the box, faulty Hydro series units from Corsair", "unixReviewTime": 1330905600, "reviewTime": "03 5, 2012"}

WTH ? No pass through or multi plexxing capability ??? No way for connecting more than 1 additional input ie: CD player/changer , tape decks , VCR's , whatever ... Also how can you not have a phono output ? Seriously ? I can't connect my super sweet wireless Sony headphones to use with this system , WEAK ! And i'm not too enthused with the lack of an on screen or automatic sourceing for video out , disappointing to say the least :( and lastly and most significantly , the S-AIR wireless speaker system is laughable and a joke , there is a sizeable box ( the transmitter unit ) that has to be powered and connected to the rear speakers and only supports or runs the surround speakers in side mode , not rear mode and essentially does away with the whole idea of wireless speakers which was one of the main reasons we went with this system , it should be more clearly explained that it is NOT wireless , atleast not fully / truly !!!  Other than all that , i do indeed like what it does do and how it sounds but feel SONY could've easily done a lil' more with this unit to make it ALOT better ...", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fantasticly overly simple", "unixReviewTime": 1292457600, "reviewTime": "12 16, 2010"}

Buyers beware- if you are looking for a camera to take pictures of kids, especially indoors look elsewhere.  The flash recycle time is unacceptably slow...and I mean SLOW! Especially if the batteries aren't straight off the charger. The camera does take pretty good pictures, very good in low light but I mainly take pix of my kiddos so I find myself often cursing missed shots while the flash recycles.

I've used it in both my cars with my simple LG cell phone, not a smart phone, and also over BT with my 2nd Gen i-Touch.  It's done everything I've hoped so far and I still have options to explore.  To this point I have not used the line-in feature to link the Touch, but honestly, the BT works so well, I don't know if I ever will.  I really like that this unit has a USB charging port on the side so I can charge my phone or Touch when using it (not both at same time, unfortuately, there's only one port).  Some of the reviews here complain that the FM reproduction is not as faithful as line in.  I guess you could say that, but I've gotten in the habit of balancing the volume levels of the Touch and the stereo until it sounds good to me.  This sort of makes up for the tiny bit of loss I hear.  But honestly, it's barely noticeable on my stereos.It seems like most of the 1-star ratings on here are surrounding the construction of the unit.  I've not had any problems yet, and haven't noticed any potential ones approaching.  I would rate the overall construction as a 4 out of 5.  The only complaints I have are minor - the pause/play, FF, and RW buttons are a bit clumsy.  Also the volume/channel control knob is super sensitive.  Half the time when I go to tweak the volume, I end up changing the channel a bit.  It's no big deal, just something I'm getting used to.  Once I make the habit of setting the volume on the unit and leaving it alone, I expect this problem to go away.  It feels like a substntial item, not a cheap plastic toy.  No problems to report there.  The BT link is as simple as any other device I've ever used and considerably more-so than some others.  It also re-links effortlessly once it's set up properly - which I really like.  No fumbling with buttons, it does it automatically every time - something I've had trouble with other BT things.I was hesitant to order this because the picture makes it look sort of clunky/goofy.  With it installed in my car, however, I think it blends in rather well and even looks sort of cool.  My truck has plenty of room for this, and my car is small - the unit works well in both areas with no complaints.  Oh, one other slight negative I discovered.  At night the red digital frequency readout on this thing is BRIGHT, and I haven't found a way yet to turn those bright red numbers down a notch.  Not sure what to do about that, but it's still totally something I'm willing to trade off for the overall awesome-ness of this unit.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "So far so good.

Light leakage (the most I have ever seen by far). Fan noise is only average. HDMI source searching does not work at all.

This projector is good enough to be used as a main TV.I love the picture quality and brightness of the BenQ W1070 1080P 3D Home Theater Projector. It didn't start out this way. When trying to mount this projector, I wanted to throw it out the window. The projector needs to be mounted or placed exactly in he middle of the screen up very high or very low. Low was impossible for me because it would have to be mounted under the couch that I sit on in order to fill my 135-inch screen. That and I would have to get rid of my coffee table because it is in the way of the picture. The only place possible for me to mount it was directly above my head where I sit. If this was in my living room, I would not be able to use this projector at all due to its MAJOR mounting limitations. Cabling is a bit more forgiving in my basement. Once the projector was mounted perfectly, and I saw the picture, I decided to not throw it away. This is my 1st DLP projector. I have used projectors for about 10 years. All of them were LCD projectors. This projector has the clearest and brightest picture. The 3D is such good quality I will actually use it. I bought (SainSonic(TM) SSZ-200DLB 144Hz 3D IR Active Rechargeable Shutter Glasses for 3D DLP-Link Ready Projector) they work well. They even work with those who wear glasses.

I could live with it, but my left hand fingers keep getting in the way and end up changing the focus point. Also, if you are changing a setting with the buttons, try not to touch the screen. I need to investigate if the touch can be disabled.Another issue with the controls when using the zoom lens is that my right thumb tends to hit the playback button frequently since it is closer to the thumb-pad now. It was not in this location on the GF1. My ZS7 and FZ35 have very nice controls and Q.Menu button works well in those cameras. The control pad buttons also seems to stick out more than other Panasonic cameras, which cause inadvertent presses. This camera is basically uncomfortable to hold with normal size hands.Lens:The 14mm pancake kit is still made in Japan with a metal mount, but the new 14-42mm is all plastic with cheaper build quality. The 14mm kit lens is very sharp edge to edge. Very compact. The 14-42mm seems to have soft focus at the wide end (14-20mm), but is pretty sharp at the tele-end out to 42mm. It's not made in Japan so maybe this creates a bias, but this lens cannot compete with the older and sharper 14-45mm that came with the GF1.Flash:The GF2 appears to have better exposure when using the built-in flash in indoor lighting. The GF1 tended to underexposed when using the flash. Perhaps this is a result of the GF2 flash moving forward.IQ:Overall IQ seems to be similar to the GF1 with some improvement when using the built-in flash.The IQ seems to best when keeping it below ISO 400. I did notice more yellow colors in shots taken with interior lighting in comparison to the Canon G12. My ZS7/FZ35 seem more red. Nothing really too noticeable. Overall I find the 14mm a bit too wide whereas the 20mm seemed just right. In good lighting (outdoors) it can match IQ of a DSLR, but not in low light.Conclusion:Panasonic took a great camera (the GF1) and made the next rev technically better, but paired it with lesser glass and forgot about the user experience when handling the camera. Sadly, the F in GF no longer stands for fun. The GF had a place between care free point-shoots and the serious DSLRs, but with the issues I noted, it doesn't make sense for me if it's not enjoyable.

You see they had it at SAM's, and I hadn't seen what the costs of these combo units were, so I thought it was a good deal. Thank goodness for the web when comparison shopping.  Now Samsung makes a more expensive model at near twice the price, and it does have features that are supposed to support those high def. sets.  It took a bit of deciding, but ultimately why pay for something that's not really set yet.It's kind of interesting all the schemes you get for devices that tell you they are ready for the future, but really are not. I had a Sony big screen (two piece projection model) TV I won in a contest back in 1981. Stereo TV was just in its infancy then, and this model was listed as \"stereo ready\".  It's not unlike all the companies that sell people HDTV ready which really means: \"we neglected to include the HDTV tuner to save cost.\" The TV I had accomplished its Stereo ready, not by having some special magic that would receive and play stereo when it was broadcast.  What it had was separate monaural amplifiers so you could play the right, and left side from some other stereo device.  It really wasn't stereo ready, it just couldn't afford to market itself as mono, being an expensive big screen and all.It seems Sony along with the other companies, are still arguing over the standards they will ultimately release to the public for High Definition DVD.  I'm guessing recording, playback and compatibility issues will be the order of the day when its finally announced. Plus with Sony now a major player in the property rights theater, I expect copy protections to be quite stringent.  What this means to you and I is that a High Def recorder bought today will be fairly useless when the standard comes out.  Most current DVDs play at about 480P on progressive scan, so they're not bad.  The higher definitions will come later down the line, so there is no reason to spend the money now.As for the model here at hand, I complement it for the nice display they have on the front.  It has reasonably simple operation, you are gonna get some complexity with a device of this type. Perhaps it was simpler for me since the remote looks like a near clone of the Sony WEGA remote.  I think remote control companies must be making for several manufacturers these days, I doubt Sony and Samsung have that much of a connection.  This unit does a nice job of direct copying of VHS cassettes to DVDs.  I bought it for that primary task, as I have a lot of home movies and other stuff to shrink down from tape.The process is not well suited for DVD copies off TIVO or some other digital recorder.  I recommend using your computer to perform those tasks.  Computers have much more memory, and likely a faster DVD recorder than these stand alone models, at least at this price.  I believe it will take much less time that way. Still for a stand alone slave, this is a decent unit. The VCR is a four head model, and of fairly high quality, so the copies come out fine if the source is up to par.This device is nothing really especially innovative so it can't get that last star from me, but for what it is I couldn't expect too much better for the price.  One more thing that shouldn't escape your attention.  The price on this is lower than many player combos have been the past few years.  It's play quality is quite good, so even if you rarely take advantage of the recording capability, you're buying a darn fine combo player too.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Too Early to go for the High Dollar Models this works fine!", "unixReviewTime": 1136073600, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2006"}

For the e-ink versions, for example, the e-ink screen actually costs MORE than the lowest priced devices, by perhaps 30% more.  Unfortunately, this most expensive component is also the most fragile. I've been unlucky enough to have broken one before.On first impression, the screen protector seems fairly solidly built- well enough that it will offer some protection from minor impacts. I hesitate to  test it with any major impacts, though... not if you want to still be able to use your Kindle.The instructions for installing the shield are clear and concise, and installation takes mere seconds. Unfortunately, it is fairly easy to get some air bubbles trapped underneath, and these aren't very easy to get rid of. The package comes with a little cardboard \"smoothing\" card for bubble removal, but that particular part is next to useless. You're much better off using a credit card for this step.In all, though, I give this shield 4 stars. Anything that adds protection to such a beloved device is a must in my book.  While I have no intention of testing its protective qualities, it at least adds a little peace of mind that it is probably protected from minor impacts.Oh, and while it says it's for 2nd generation kindles, the touch and the keyboard, it's also a perfect fit for the screen of the 1st generation kindle as well.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works for 1st Generation Kindles too!", "unixReviewTime": 1344902400, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2012"}

And I must say I am very impressed by this product.My previous set of earbuds were made by V-moda and, although I enjoyed them, I felt there was a bit to much bass for my liking.  When the V-modas's bit the dust I based my purchase of the Klipsch on the fact that the stereo system in the office where I work has Klipsch speakers and I liked the clean open sound of them.  I figured I'd take a chance that the earbuds had that same quality.The IMAGE S4s seem to me to have a wider soundstage than the V-moda.  What I'm hearing more clearly now is the rhythm guitar in some songs and the background instrumentation in others that I'd never heard before.  The best part is that the Klipsch buds do not skimp on the bass response. It's there.  It's noticeable.  And it's clean. I enjoy anything from classical to country to jazz to classic rock and these buds do justice to them all.My only problem is with the silicone tips.  I can't really blame Klipsch because I've never come across a tip that was \"really\" comfortable.  For me the large tips are too big, the small ones too small and the medium ones not real comfortable.

I highly recommend it, and for the price and features it cannot be beat.

It was missing the camera registration, camera manual, and the K-30 startup CD.I called Pentax America regarding the camera being shipped without the warranty registration, and was informed that no new Pentax cameras should be shipped WITHOUT the original (new) owner's serialized registration.Then I called Electronic Basket and asked for the original (serialized) registration and was informed that their standard practice is to NOT send it with the camera because THEY (Electronic Basket) registers the camera FOR THE PURCHASER!After inquiring on several of the national Pentax forums, it was obvious that Electron Basket was outright misrepresenting the facts.  I asked for the original warranty registration be sent to me, so that I could have the K-30 covered under the original purchaser's manufacture's warranty. I was informed that if the camera became defective, I would have to SEND IT BACK TO ELECTRONIC BASKET, who would then send it to Pentax for repairs!!I still have yet to receive the K-30 I purchased warranty registration card, or any other means of registering it online or otherwise.EB did offer a discounted price on the WR 18-135mm lens, which I considered purchasing.  I then learned that EB does NOT accept credit card payments, ONLY PAYPAL.It is not known if the K-30 I received was a return, a defect, or what, since the original (serialized) registration was not included in the (cannibalized) kit box.  It's hilariously unprofessional behavior.  Whoever cannibalized the kit even left the WR 18-135mm lens hood in the box!The K-30 is a precision camera that takes wonderful pictures, with features that will delight any photographer, from beginner to Pro.Electronics Basket however should be avoided.Select another vendor from Amazon.

After that, I built my own DTV antenna with coat hangers (many build plans are on the internet) which is a big improvement over the rabbit ears.  Yet even with the coat hanger antenna, my reception still gets the issues described earlier.  I was hoping that The Leaf antenna would resolve the problems, but it did not.  I suppose the reason may because CBS by me is on VHF and  that The Leaf is better for UHF signals. Also, even the UHF stations that The Leaf pulled in still encountered the pixelations when a freight train passed by.As a result, I decided to just return The Leaf and stick to my old, bulky, yet effective for the most part, coat hanger antenna.What I like:- simple design. Almost the size and weight of a laminated thin cardboard- reasonable priceWhat I dislike:- doesn't handle VHF as well as UHFAlthough The Leaf antenna didn't fix the issues I have with my DTV reception, it still is a great design.

The bag was easy to use, had more than enough compartments for me, and was so good, I quickly sold out of them at the retail store I worked at (I worked as a manager for a local camera shop from 2007-2009).  Everyone felt my enthusiasm for this product.In 2009, my girlfriend got into photography with a Canon XTi, and I had an older smaller Lowepro bag laying around.  It was fine for her until I upgraded to a Canon 7D, and she inherited my old 50D.  Now, she needed a bigger bag to accommodate the larger camera and battery grip.  So, after looking around, I ordered the SlingShot 302AW, thinking it was just a slightly bigger bag.Well, I was wrong - in a good way!Lowepro kept all of the great features of the older model, but added some more pockets, improved the interior layout, and beefed up the bag.  All in all, it is a vastly superior product, and at an incredible price.  My bag holds my 7D with battery grip, a 4 lenses, mis accessories, a 580EX flash, manuals, pens, survival stuff, and even some trail mix!

Eldridge", "helpful": [4, 8], "reviewText": "As much as I enjoy the games for the Wii and Wii U...- As interesting as the Gamepad is, I absolutely hate the way it is implemented. First of all, it is an absolute requirement. You cannot set up your Wii U without it, even though most menu screens on the TV just tell you to look at the Gamepad. Few games seem to be able to make any use of the Gamepad, but all Games I tried require it to be used as the first player controller and you can't turn off the screen. That makes it VERY distracting. (well, you can turn the screen off, not while using it as a controller. The moment you press any buttons the screen comes back on.) Even the game this came with, Super Mario Bros. U, which is capable of using it as a 5th player (very nice idea!), still requires you to use it for the first player in single player mode. The irony is that in single player mode none of the touch screen features are active, so there is no point requiring it. (This makes it distinct from the old complaints people had with Wiimotes, which were required because they were used. Since the screen isn't used, why it is required? And at half the cost of the entire console... )- The largest problem with all of this isn't mere annoyance though, it is poor battery life. The Gamepad only lasts for a few hours, which might work for kids with a curfew, but not for adults with a day off to play or a party. The lights blink red when it was about to die, but how often is anyone looking at that when focused on the TV screen? Turns out this was actually by design though. The battery that ships is a reduced capacity battery. If you spent an extra $30 to Nintendo directly they will ship you the original capacity battery (they call it extended, which is hilarious since that's the size it was designed to have) it will last more than 12 hours, which is more than enough time for my needs. When the power finally does go out the game just hangs. No pause button, no home button. You could be in the middle of something and suddenly your character will just die. Couldn't they program it to pause when the power goes out, like literally every other wireless console on the planet? Even the GAMECUBE would pause the game when a wireless controller dies! Huge step back, Nintendo!- The ability to break away from the TV is a very interesting option, but the range is too weak. The most I can do with it is play in the same room next to someone else on the couch playing a different game.If they could build an NFC repeater to extend the signal it would solve that problem and make it usable anywhere in the house, at which point I would love the feature, but as it stands I never really use it.- I found it interesting that you could use the Gamepad as a TV screen for the Wii games to point the Wiimote at, but unfortunately you can't just pull the Gamepad off the cradle and load it up while someone is using the TV. At some point the Gamepad will tell you to look at the TV to make a selection with a Wiimote there, which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Who came up with that? Also, Wiiware games in Wiimode that require a classic controller still require it, so breaking away from the TV is extra impractical. You would need a Gamepad, a Wiimote, and a Classic controller all working together when it would make more sense to allow the classic controller to be emulated by the Gamepad controls. That ability right there would have been amazing.- Definitely not a party console. At least not yet. There are a few games with party appeal, but when I host a game night I would fully expect everyone to choose the Wii games or PS3 arcade games. Not the Wii U. Where's it's niche?- I hate hate HATE!!! WaraWara Plaza! It's always on! You can't turn it off! The most you can do is switch between which screen sees it, the TV or the Gamepad. You also can't shut it up! Even in parental controls, which is supposed to block it, Nintendo advertisements keep running. So ya, Nintendo is pushing game ads in my face all the freaking time. Even as a social network it's useless because they are overly restrictive on what you can do or say.- I didn't like how it requires your old Wii console be wiped first. This is a major problem because if the Wii U breaks or needs repairs or even if you want to return it you are stuck. To avoid this I backed up the EmuNAND and restored it after a system transfer.- I didn't like the loss of Gamecube support. The Wii U is physically capable of running Gamecube games, but they cut out the hardware that holds the Gamecube disc in place along with the memory card slots and controller ports. All they would have to have done is sell a slot loading mini DVD case, allow other controllers to take the place of the Gamecube controllers, and emulate the memory card and it would work perfectly........I really do like Nintendo's attempt at innovation, but overall it's as if they never stopped to consider how people would actually want to make use of those innovations. Maybe if the Wii U becomes a party console again, fixes the NFC range issue, and fixes the Gamepad use requirements, I would love the Wii U, but right now it's just... well, I never thought I would say this about any Nintendo console because I have been a Nintendo customer since the NES and original Gameboy and owned them all... but...

They have one cord to connect them as well as charge them. Each speaker has an expansive resonator feature which gives the best low frequency output. The speakers don't sound great with low frequency music at first, but then you twist them and open up the expansive resonator and they will blow you away!The base of the speakers is magnetic, for easy portability. Just stick the two speakers together and stick them and the cord in the included pouch and take them on-the-go anywhere!This is a great set of speakers for people who want to take their music with them on the go, and really great for those people who don't have bluetooth devices.

If you are planning on using one of them as a simple router, it is a great device; powerful, reliable, great range and lots of features, including the ability to enable/disable the 2.4 or 5Ghz spectrums, as well as enable/disable a separate guest network.The interface is pretty clean and easy to use, and I like that you can have the device check for firmware updates itself right through the configuration interface; no need to go to the manufacturer's website, figure out exactly which model and hardware revision you have, manually download the file, manually upload it to the router, etc. etc.Updating the device firmware on this Netgear router is far easier than with most other brands, as the router handles it all itself and defaults to checking for updated firmware every time you login to the device, which is nice, and can be disabled if you need to frequently login to the device.Speaking of firmware, that brings us to our big, gaping flaw and the reason I only gave this device a four-star rating:The repeat function absolutely does not work. Do NOT plan on purchasing two of these routers with the intent of using one as a base station and the other as a repeater to extend the range of your wireless network, because as of Nov. 2010, there is a firmware bug that simply doesn't allow this feature to work.After driving myself insane messing with it, I did some research online and on Netgear's support forums, it is clear that there's a known bug that prevents the repeat function from working.This has gone unresolved for months - I don't recall the exact dates of all the threads I read, but Netgear, through their support forums, has been aware of the issue for many months and still no new firmware, at least not as of Nov. 2010.That's a real shame as Netgear is one of the only companies whose networking products I trust, the other being Linksys/Cisco.I do hope they will address this big issue very quickly, as this seems to be their flagship consumer router.Anyhow, again, if you are looking for a single, simple router, this guy is great, just don't plan on buying a twin to use to extend the range of your network, as it won't work.

I mainly got it because I want to have a nice camera that I don't have to be extra careful with. I work with kids and take a lot of pictures, and they inevitably want to use my camera to take pictures and I usually let them, but I tend to hover to make sure it doesn't get accidently dropped in the sandbox or in a tub of water. Now, I'm happy that I won't have to worry about this anymore. This camera can withstand a 5 foot drop onto concrete or into water.I don't have much use for the tap feature, which is designed to be used with gloves, because I live in southern California. It's more annoying to have it activated when you don't need it but I'm sure it's a great feature for when you are bundled up and you don't want to take your gloves off.I really like the portrait modes the stylus has because it makes it east to quickly switch to different modes. The screen helps you switch to different modes too, it is pretty bright and it is a lot easier to see in daylight than previous cameras I have owned.I have yet to really take it on an underwater excursion, but I have tested it out in the sink a few times and in the bath and there was not any water seepage into the battery compartment or in the USB port.I love the ability to do in-camera fixes with red eye and lighting. The camera also automatically saves the edited picture separate from the old, so you don't have to worry about it replacing the original picture, if you don't like the new effect.I love the fact that this camera has a built in memory. You can only a take a few pictures with it, but you don't get that \"No memory card\" error anymore. It's a good feature to have in a pinch, especially when you first get it to test out the features. The camera also tells you in the corner how many pictures you have left and how many minutes of video you have left on the card or in the internal memory. No more snapping away pictures only to hear the beep! beep! and see the \"memory full\" words pop up on the screen; then there's the scramble to quickly delete pictures. You'll never have to guess how many shots you have left.I've only had the camera a few days and I haven't tried out all of the features, and I am looking forward to that and I will update my review. I have yet to use the in camera panorama feature, I am pretty sure that you have to have an Olympus card in order for this to work and I am using the micro SD card adapter and using a 2 MP card.The program that comes with the camera is also pretty good and user friendly. It has the same feel as Google's Picasa, but I haven't played with it much yet because I really like Picasa!There are a couple of things I don't really like about the camera. One is I wish there were more features for the video camera, it pretty much has an option of 15 fps and 30 fps. My older camera has about 10 different video options. Two, is that I don't think picture quality is as great as a Canon with the same number of mega pixels. The picture comes out looking a little more digital and not as crisp. But I will gladly give up a little picture quality for a camera that comes with all of the underwater, freeze proof, etc features.So, I think this camera is definitely worth the price, and if I had $100 more to spend I would have definitely gotten the 8000. I love its versatility with being a real outdoorsy camera, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a high end digital camera that can withstand some drops and some water.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "love the versitility of the camera", "unixReviewTime": 1233964800, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2009"}

Recently ditched my iPhone 4S for a Galaxy S4 because I needed a phone with a larger display.  Was very happy with my iPhone being hardwired to my Insignia TV using an iPhone HDMI adapter and never had any problems whatsoever.  Used it mainly to AirPlay video podcasts from the phone to the large TV screen.Recently, I bought an Apple TV, however, using an Android phone with so-called &#34;AirPlay beaming apps&#34; to beam content from the Android phone to the Apple TV has sometimes been problematic; have to use multiple apps depending on what content I want to watch.  Also, for some strange reason, most PBS video podcasts will not play directly on the Apple TV or from PBS using the beaming apps on my Android phone, which is very weird.  I have Apple looking into that issue.Anyhow, back on topic, I was going to get the Samsung AllShare Cast Dongle (wireless), however, after reading about all the problems in the Amazon reviews that many people had with that (especially setup and lag time with videos and video quality), I decided to go hardwired, especially since I only paid $16.00 (with free Prime shipping) this week for the hardwired MHL 2.0 adapter.  I was hoping to return my Apple TV for a full refund, but since it appears that the $16.00 Samsung adapter isn't going to work, I have to keep the Apple TV or be without a way to do what I want to do.  Stuff simply shouldn't be this difficult!I have spent the literally past three hours (that I really cannot spare, and will hang up with tech support if not resolved in next 30 minutes) troubleshooting with Samsung Tech Support chat and am on my THIRD telephone support employee (a senior technician, who I am holding for).I followed all instructions implicitly, read all the negative reviews on Amazon for tips (which I also followed), but it simply doesn't work (with or without the power cord being plugged into the adapter, which is said not to even be necessary with the Galaxy S4 phone, since the adapter is said to be MHL 2.0).I guess I will have to relent and keep the Apple TV (3rd Generation) device, so that I can watch podcasts on the big screen.  One thing is for sure, at least I have a direct line into Apple where I can spend 5 minutes sending an email and not spend hours on the phone with them like I am with Samsung!In any event, one Samsung tech told me &#34;We only guarantee the HDTV Adapter with Samsung TVs,&#34; which I think is very very lame since that isn't in any of the marketing materials when they sell these products.  Since this MHL 2.0 is new as of March 2013 (according to the date on the back of the teeny-tiny instruction booklet that comes with it), the one-star reviews on Amazon will only grow as many consumers will discover that this product simply might not be compatible with thousands of HDTVs on the market today!I do not believe there is anything wrong with a new factory-sealed adapter sold to me directly by Amazon (or at least fulfilled by Amazon), if memory serves me correctly.  They will be receiving a major complaint from me, too!This really sucks, because BeyondPod app for Android does such a nice job with podcasts on the Galaxy phone and all I want to do is see it on a bigger screen; is that too much to ask?

{"reviewerID": "A33O79GQ8QW4TU", "asin": "B0007YFQCG", "reviewerName": "Booboo Tutball", "helpful": [53, 54], "reviewText": "The EH50S is my second Panasonic DVD recorder, the E80H I got 18 months ago worked so well that I decided to buy a second unit for my other home.I won't repeat the comments you can read elsewhere, but I will discuss the couple issues that have not been mentioned before.If you plan to perform editing on this unit (such as editing out commercials before archiving to DVD), you will need to do a lot of fast-forward/fast-backward/pause/play maneuvers to skip over the unwanted parts.  In the EH-50S, each press of the fast-forward will take you to a higher speed, and there are a total of 5 levels (2x,10x,30x,70x,200x).  Naturally, you want something faster than 2x or 10x while searching forward/backward (30x and 70x are good choices) to seek out the commercial breaks to edit them out.  The typical key press is to hit fast forward 3-4 times successively to get to the higher speed, and hit play/pause when the unwanted part begins/ends so you can locate the specific points to begin/end editing.That is where the problem with this unit lies - when you press fast-forward/backward multiple times successively, it queues up your key presses and it can take over 6 seconds after the last key press to get to the speed you want.  It will not execute any other command such as play/pause/stop until it is finished with the queued commands.  So it is a guarantee that you will always overshoot the point you want to stop if you engage high speed search.  6 seconds may not sound long when you read this, but if you are in 70x speed, even 3 seconds is overshooting the stopping point by 3+ minutes of programming, I can assure you that you will swear at this recorder more than once per edit.  As a result, if you edit often, you do not want this recorder (Interestingly, the old E80H, with the latest firmware, provides almost instantaneous responses).  Unfortunately, Panasonic never released a newer version of the EH50S firmware since its release.This problem is not related to the new hard-drive \"sleep mode\", as the drive is already spinning at full speed when you edit.  I work in computer hardware/software for 20 years, I believe it is the result of poor firmware design.  Hard drive sleep mode as a way to improve durability is a marketing gimmick, its true value lies in reduced power consumption and heat generation.  A typical consumer-grade hard drive provides a 600,000 hours of mean-time-between-failure (MTBF), that is 68 years of 24x7 non-stop operation!  You have other problems to worry about if you are still using the unit in 2073.  (The commercial grade drives is in the 1.4+ million hour range, but surely that's not what Panasonic put in the unit).In LP mode, very fast motion of contrasting color objects (like a person dancing in colorful clothing) can cause an image breakdown: the affected area turned into big blocky shapes.  This is rare, but the problem was not in the older model.  The LP mode in the EH50S is supposed to equal the SP mode quality in the E80H, but it is perhaps only true in programs with little transitions.  With sports program, LP is useless.  You should only use LP mode for something that you don't plan to archive. I definitely consider this the second show-stopper for this recorder.On the bright side, the dubbing speed is very fast.  In LP mode, it can dub a 60 min video in less than 2 minutes (assuming you have the right disks), which is up to 8 times faster than the older model.  It also allows you to view regular program during dubbing, while the E80H forces you to watch a blue status screen until dubbing completes (which can take a long time depending on the length of the dubbing materials).Panasonic took some cost cuting in the EH50S, the control on the units is fewer than in the older model, the display is cheaper and less sophisticated.  The brush metal overlay on the older remote is gone, replaced by a full plastic design.  But the unit also costs a lot less, so you get what you pay for.I have cable without a cable box, TV Guide works as advertised.The recorders is sensitive to power interruption, it displayed a U99 failure message intermittently after a power outage.  I reformatted the hard-drive and the problem disappeared.  In this respect, it is no different than a computer.Overall, the flexibility to archive to four disk formats is a big plus for me.  I hope Panasonic will release a firmware update soon to fix the image breakdown issue and improve the response of the fast forward/backward keys, as well as the general key press responses.  If they fix these two issues, then I would recommend the recorder wholeheartedly.  In the current state, I believe the EH50S is a couple steps back from designs that is two generations older, which is a huge disappointment.However, if you rarely edit and just use the unit to record/time-slip programs, then you shouldn't be concerned about the slow key-press responses.If you edit, I give this recorder 1-star, you will learn to hate the EH50S, so look elsewhere.  If you don't edit and records at SP or higher speed, I give it a 5 star.I bought the EH50S because of the positive experience from the older E80H.  Now with the sluggish EH50S, I will not buy another Panasonic recorder unless they can prove that the future model is indeed better.After the release of the EH50S, Panasonic came to a screeching halt in releasing new hard-drive-based recorders since early 2005.  It became the only new model with a hard disk drive, a far cry from the previous lineup (their two higher end models are of the previous generation).  I wonder if Panasonic realized the flaws in the EH50S and is delaying the release of newer and higher-end models.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Issues you don't see in previous reviews", "unixReviewTime": 1128902400, "reviewTime": "10 10, 2005"}

The points I will edit will be data from the actual Windows install and Crystal Disk Mark Benches.[---Difference between this drive (The 'new' Momentus XT) and the Seagate Hybrid Hard Drive (mentioned above)---]Honestly I the hard drive mentioned above, the Hybrid, has the exact same specs, except for being 500 gb, however it posted slightly better read/write speeds. Other than that slight difference, which may not be a difference at all, this drive and the above are both 64mb cache and 5200 RPMs with 8 GB of SSD storage.[---Review (some copied from my earlier review on the Hybrid drive)---]The purpose of this hard drive is to mimic a lot of 'computer' configurations where someone will install a smaller full SSD (anywhere from 32 GB to 256GB) alongside a bigger 'mechanical' or platter hard drive (1TB or more). The latter is to have great performance while also saving a bit of money. The most expensive configuration you could have, with maximum speed, is to have just full SSDs in raid array. The least expensive is to have just mechanical hard drives. Obviously with all of the previous configurations you are sacrificing something somewhere in each of them:1. With a configuration of all SSDs you are marginally sacrificing reliability, to a point. I say this because there is a chance of an SSD failure (most businesses still use mechanical hard drives for this reason) though in all honesty, I trust my SSDs more than a mechanical hard drive.2. With a configuration of all mechanical hard drives you are sacrificing speed (a drastic loss in speed compared to SSDs) with the advantage of having much more space at a lower cost (a 1 TB SSD costs around 550$--crucial--whereas you can find a 1 TB mechanical hard drive for 80$ or less).---Review of Drive---With the lead-in aside, this superspeed drive is basically made to mimic a balance between 1 & 2--which a lot of people have a combination of already in the form of an SSD for the operating system and a big mechanical hard drive for data. The Seagate Superspeed drive is to eliminate space, and put it in 1 form factor and designed for a laptop/ultrabook. I installed this on my laptop in the SATA III port and installed Windows 7 via a USB 2.0 Flash Drive.Seagate Superspeed specs:64 mb cache5400 RPMMLC NAND Flash MemoryStorage Specs within the Seagate hybrid:1TB (the actual literal storage made up of:8GB of SSD MLC NAND935GB of space on the mechanical hard disk (5400 rpm)As you can see from above, you have minimal SSD space. A typical, non-sale, 1 TB platter drive is around 80$ or so. Here you are paying the extra 40$ for 8GB of SSD space. That is roughly 5.00$ per SSD GB. Currently, pure SSDs can be bought for about 1.38$ a GB (Crucial M500 240GB SATA 2.5-Inch 7mm (with 9.5mm adapter) Internal Solid State Drive CT240M500SSD1). With this drive there is a bit of a markup--for the convenience of owning a 2-in-1. The question now is, is this drive worth it?The short answer is, yes, only if one of these reasons:1. You have to have more than 900 GB of space and are on a budget of around 100$**If you have the ability to place 2 hard drives in your laptop/desktop here is a possible configuration for you that will cost just slightly more (20$) than this hybrid drive:1 x 1 TB Harddrive 54$Seagate Barracuda 1 TB HDD SATA 6 Gb/s NCQ 64MB Cache 3.5-Inch Internal Bare Drive ST1000DM0031 x 32GB SSD 44$ at 1.375$ per GB ADATA USA Premier Pro SP600 2.5-Inch 32 GB SATA III MLC Internal Solid State Drive ASP600S3-32GM-CTotal: 94$ - Note that the bigger SSD you get the better price per GB you receive where to tapers out to the 'sweet spot' at 250GB SSDs2. Your laptop only fits 1 Harddrive and you do not always want to use an external storage device.3.

Though it boots faster, the mechanical hard drive kicks in with the majority of tasks when you use the computer.This drive is very appropriate for the light user who does not do more than internet browsing and opening constituent programs. You can also do other things on this but if you make this your dedicated workstation you will see slowdown as appropriate to a normal mechanical hard drive. For those that do not want to transition to a sole SSD but have the boot-times of one with the storage of a mechanical hard drive, this will give you that type of production.
